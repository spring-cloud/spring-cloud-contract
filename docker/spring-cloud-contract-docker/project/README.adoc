## Developer tips

### Environment variables
In order to use a new environment variable inside the Gradle script, you need to add it to the `envVars` map together with a description and a default value. Otherwise, any attempt to resolve such an environment variable will lead to an exception being thrown.

If you're referencing any environment variables from inside the Java code please follow the following convention.

```java
/**
 * Some description.
 **/
@Value("${ENV_VAR_NAME:defaultValue}")
String envVar;
```

If you provide Javadocs, we will automatically parse any `@Value` annotated fields and build a table of environment variables with description and default values.

### Customizing the gradle build

You can provide a customized `gradle.build` to be run in the container by mounting your customized build file as a volume when running the container:

`docker run -v <absolute-path-of-your-custom-file>:/spring-cloud-contract/build.gradle springcloud/spring-cloud-contract:<version>`
