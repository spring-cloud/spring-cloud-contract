= Spring Cloud Contract Verifier Samples

Projects that contain different samples of Spring Cloud Contract Verifier.

WARNING: The Verifier Maven Plugin is disabled by default. That's because we want in the
 IDE help in terms of compilation verification. If someone executes `./mvnw clean install`
 from the root of the `Spring Cloud Contract` project the samples will not blow up. To
 ensure that you're running the `Verifier` tests you have to pass the `-Ptests` from the
 `spring-cloud-contract-verifier-standalone-test-samples` project. Or just run the tests
 from each of the standalone sample projects (since each of them is a separate Maven project).
