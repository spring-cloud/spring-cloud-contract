<title>Spring Cloud Contract</title>
<simpara>What you always need is confidence in pushing new features into a new application or service in a distributed system.
This project provides support for Consumer Driven Contracts and service schemas in Spring applications, covering a
range of options for writing tests, publishing them as assets, asserting that a contract is kept by producers
and consumers, for HTTP and message-based interactions.</simpara>

<title>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier Introduction</title>
<tip>
<simpara>The Accurest project was initially started by Marcin Grzejszczak and Jakub Kubrynski (<link xl:href="http://codearte.io">codearte.io</link>)</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>Just to make long story short - Spring Cloud Contract Verifier is a tool that enables Consumer Driven Contract (CDC) development of JVM-based applications. It is shipped
with <emphasis>Contract Definition Language</emphasis> (DSL). Contract definitions are used to produce following resources:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>JSON stub definitions to be used by WireMock when doing integration testing on the client code (<emphasis>client tests</emphasis>).
Test code must still be written by hand, test data is produced by Spring Cloud Contract Verifier.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Messaging routes if you&#8217;re using one. We&#8217;re integrating with Spring Integration, Spring Cloud Stream, Spring AMQP and Apache Camel. You can however set your own integrations if you want to</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Acceptance tests (in JUnit or Spock) used to verify if server-side implementation of the API is compliant with the contract (<emphasis>server tests</emphasis>).
Full test is generated by Spring Cloud Contract Verifier.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier moves TDD to the level of software architecture.</simpara>

<title>Testing issues</title>
<simpara>If we wanted to test the application in top left corner if it can communicate with other services then we could do one of two things:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>deploy all microservices and perform end to end tests</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>mock other microservices in unit / integration tests</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Both have their advantages but also a lot of disadvantages. Let&#8217;s focus on the latter.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Deploy all microservices and perform end to end tests</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Advantages:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>simulates production</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>tests real communication between services</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Disadvantages:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>to test one microservice we would have to deploy 6 microservices, a couple of databases etc.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>the environment where the tests would be conducted would be locked for a single suite of tests (i.e. nobody else would be able to run the tests in the meantime).</simpara>

<simpara>Advantages:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>very fast feedback</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>no infrastructure requirements</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Disadvantages:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>the implementor of the service creates stubs thus they might have nothing to do with the reality</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>you can go to production with passing tests and failing production</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>To solve the aforementioned issues Spring Cloud Contract Verifier with Stub Runner were created. Their main idea is to give you very fast feedback, without the need
to set up the whole world of microservices. If you work on stubs then the only applications you need are those that your application is using directly.</simpara>

<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier gives you the certainty that the stubs that you&#8217;re using were created by the service that you&#8217;re calling. Also if you can use them it means that they were
tested against the producer&#8217;s side. In other words - you can trust those stubs.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_purposes">
<title>Purposes</title>
<simpara>The main purposes of Spring Cloud Contract Verifier with Stub Runner are:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>to ensure that WireMock / Messaging stubs (used when developing the client) are doing exactly what actual server-side implementation will do,</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>to promote ATDD method and Microservices architectural style,</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>to provide a way to publish changes in contracts that are immediately visible on both sides,</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>to generate boilerplate test code used on the server side.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<important>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier&#8217;s purpose is NOT to start writing business features in the contracts.
Let&#8217;s assume that we have a business use case of fraud check. If a user can be a fraud for 100 different reasons,
we would assume that you would create 2 contracts. One for the positive and one for the negative fraud case.
Contract tests are used to test contracts between applications and not to simulate full behaviour.</simpara>
</important>
</section>
<section xml:id="_how">
<title>How</title>
<section xml:id="_define_the_contract">
<title>Define the contract</title>
<simpara>As consumers we need to define what exactly we want to achieve. We need to formulate our expectations. That&#8217;s why we write the following contract.</simpara>
<simpara>Let’s assume that we’d like to send the request containing the id of the client and the amount he wants to borrow from us. We’d like to send it to the /fraudcheck url via the PUT method.</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">package contracts

org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
	request { // (1)
		method 'PUT' // (2)
		url '/fraudcheck' // (3)
		body([ // (4)
			   "client.id": $(regex('[0-9]{10}')),
			   loanAmount: 99999
		])
		headers { // (5)
			contentType('application/json')
		}
	}
	response { // (6)
		status 200 // (7)
		body([ // (8)
			   fraudCheckStatus: "FRAUD",
			   "rejection.reason": "Amount too high"
		])
		headers { // (9)
			contentType('application/json')
		}
	}
}

/*
From the Consumer perspective, when shooting a request in the integration test:

(1) - If the consumer sends a request
(2) - With the "PUT" method
(3) - to the URL "/fraudcheck"
(4) - with the JSON body that
 * has a field `clientId` that matches a regular expression `[0-9]{10}`
 * has a field `loanAmount` that is equal to `99999`
(5) - with header `Content-Type` equal to `application/json`
(6) - then the response will be sent with
(7) - status equal `200`
(8) - and JSON body equal to
 { "fraudCheckStatus": "FRAUD", "rejectionReason": "Amount too high" }
(9) - with header `Content-Type` equal to `application/json`

From the Producer perspective, in the autogenerated producer-side test:

(1) - A request will be sent to the producer
(2) - With the "PUT" method
(3) - to the URL "/fraudcheck"
(4) - with the JSON body that
 * has a field `clientId` that will have a generated value that matches a regular expression `[0-9]{10}`
 * has a field `loanAmount` that is equal to `99999`
(5) - with header `Content-Type` equal to `application/json`
(6) - then the test will assert if the response has been sent with
(7) - status equal `200`
(8) - and JSON body equal to
 { "fraudCheckStatus": "FRAUD", "rejectionReason": "Amount too high" }
(9) - with header `Content-Type` matching `application/json.*`
 */</programlisting>
</section>
<section xml:id="_client_side">
<title>Client Side</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract will generate stubs, which you can use during client side testing.
You will have a WireMock instance / Messaging route up and running that simulates the service Y.
You would like to feed that instance with a proper stub definition.</simpara>
<simpara>At some point in time you need to send a request to the Fraud Detection service.</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">ResponseEntity&lt;FraudServiceResponse&gt; response =
		restTemplate.exchange("http://localhost:" + port + "/fraudcheck", HttpMethod.PUT,
				new HttpEntity&lt;&gt;(request, httpHeaders),
				FraudServiceResponse.class);</programlisting>
<simpara>Annotate your test class with <literal>@AutoConfigureStubRunner</literal>. In the annotation provide the group id and artifact id for the Stub Runner to download stubs of your collaborators.</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment=WebEnvironment.NONE)
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:+:stubs:6565"}, workOffline = true)
@DirtiesContext
public class LoanApplicationServiceTests {</programlisting>
<simpara>After that, during the tests Spring Cloud Contract will automatically find the stubs (simulating the real service) in Maven repository and expose them on configured (or random) port.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_server_side">
<title>Server Side</title>
<simpara>Being a service Y since you are developing your stub, you need to be sure that it&#8217;s actually resembling your
concrete implementation. You can&#8217;t have a situation where your stub acts in one way and your application on
production behaves in a different way.</simpara>
<simpara>That&#8217;s why from the provided stub acceptance tests will be generated that will ensure
that your application behaves in the same way as you define in your stub.</simpara>
<simpara>The autogenerated test would look like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Test
public void validate_shouldMarkClientAsFraud() throws Exception {
    // given:
        MockMvcRequestSpecification request = given()
                .header("Content-Type", "application/vnd.fraud.v1+json")
                .body("{\"client.id\":\"1234567890\",\"loanAmount\":99999}");

    // when:
        ResponseOptions response = given().spec(request)
                .put("/fraudcheck");

    // then:
        assertThat(response.statusCode()).isEqualTo(200);
        assertThat(response.header("Content-Type")).matches("application/vnd.fraud.v1.json.*");
    // and:
        DocumentContext parsedJson = JsonPath.parse(response.getBody().asString());
        assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("['fraudCheckStatus']").matches("[A-Z]{5}");
        assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("['rejection.reason']").isEqualTo("Amount too high");

<title>Step by step guide to CDC</title>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s take an example of Fraud Detection and Loan Issuance process. The business scenario is such that we want to issue loans to people but don&#8217;t want them to steal the money from us. The current implementation of our system grants loans to everybody.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s assume that the <literal>Loan Issuance</literal> is a client to the
<literal>Fraud Detection</literal> server. In the current sprint we are required to develop a new feature - if a client wants to borrow too much money then we mark him as fraud.</simpara>
<simpara>Technical remark - Fraud Detection will have artifact id <literal>http-server</literal>, Loan Issuance <literal>http-client</literal> and both have group id <literal>com.example</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Social remark - both client and server development teams need to communicate directly and discuss changes while
going through the process. CDC is all about communication.</simpara>
<simpara>The <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/1.0.x/samples/standalone/dsl/http-server">server side code is available here</link> and <link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/1.0.x/samples/standalone/dsl/http-client">the client side code here</link>.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>In this case the ownership of the contracts lays on the producer side. It means that physically
all the contract are present in the producer&#8217;s repository</simpara>

<simpara>The Contract is written using a statically typed Groovy DSL. You might be wondering what are those
<literal>value(client(&#8230;&#8203;), server(&#8230;&#8203;))</literal> parts. By using this notation Spring Cloud Contract allows you to
define parts of a JSON / URL / etc. which are dynamic. In case of an identifier or a timestamp you
don&#8217;t want to hardcode a value. You want to allow some different ranges of values. That&#8217;s why for
the consumer side you can set regular expressions matching those values. You can provide the body
either by means of a map notation or String with interpolations.
<link xl:href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_contract_dsl">Consult the docs
for more information.</link> We highly recommend using the map notation!</simpara>

<simpara>It&#8217;s really important that you understand the map notation to set up contracts. Please read the

&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<important>
<simpara>We&#8217;ve decided to use the "convention based" naming by setting the <literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal> property.
That means that 2 last packages will be combined into a name of the base test class. In our case the contracts
were placed under <literal>src/test/resources/contracts/fraud</literal>. Since we don&#8217;t have 2 packages starting from the <literal>contracts</literal>
folder we&#8217;re picking only one which is <literal>fraud</literal>. We&#8217;re adding the <literal>Base</literal> suffix and we&#8217;re capitalizing <literal>fraud</literal>.
That gives us the <literal>FraudBase</literal> test class name.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>That&#8217;s because all the generated tests will extend that class. Over there you can set up your Spring Context or
whatever is necessary. In our case we&#8217;re using <link xl:href="http://rest-assured.io/">Rest Assured MVC</link> to start the server side <literal>FraudDetectionController</literal>.</simpara>

	public void assertThatRejectionReasonIsNull(Object rejectionReason) {

<simpara>Now, if you run the <literal>./mvnw clean install</literal> you would get sth like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">Results :

Tests in error:
  ContractVerifierTest.validate_shouldMarkClientAsFraud:32 » IllegalState Parsed...</programlisting>
<simpara>That&#8217;s because you have a new contract from which a test was generated and it failed since you haven&#8217;t implemented the feature. The autogenerated test would look like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Test
public void validate_shouldMarkClientAsFraud() throws Exception {
    // given:
        MockMvcRequestSpecification request = given()
                .header("Content-Type", "application/vnd.fraud.v1+json")
                .body("{\"client.id\":\"1234567890\",\"loanAmount\":99999}");

    // when:
        ResponseOptions response = given().spec(request)
                .put("/fraudcheck");

    // then:
        assertThat(response.statusCode()).isEqualTo(200);
        assertThat(response.header("Content-Type")).matches("application/vnd.fraud.v1.json.*");
    // and:
        DocumentContext parsedJson = JsonPath.parse(response.getBody().asString());
        assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("['fraudCheckStatus']").matches("[A-Z]{5}");
        assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("['rejection.reason']").isEqualTo("Amount too high");
}</programlisting>
<simpara>As you can see all the <literal>producer()</literal> parts of the Contract that were present in the <literal>value(consumer(&#8230;&#8203;), producer(&#8230;&#8203;))</literal> blocks got injected into the test.</simpara>
<simpara>What&#8217;s important here to note is that on the producer side we also are doing TDD. We have expectations in form of a test. This test is shooting a request to our own application to an URL, headers and body defined in the contract. It also is expecting very precisely defined values in the response. In other words you have is your <literal>red</literal> part of <literal>red</literal>, <literal>green</literal> and <literal>refactor</literal>. Time to convert the <literal>red</literal> into the <literal>green</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">write the missing implementation</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Now since we now what is the expected input and expected output let&#8217;s write the missing implementation.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RequestMapping(value = "/fraudcheck", method = PUT)
public FraudCheckResult fraudCheck(@RequestBody FraudCheck fraudCheck) {
if (amountGreaterThanThreshold(fraudCheck)) {
	return new FraudCheckResult(FraudCheckStatus.FRAUD, AMOUNT_TOO_HIGH);
}
return new FraudCheckResult(FraudCheckStatus.OK, NO_REASON);
}</programlisting>
<simpara>If we execute <literal>./mvnw clean install</literal> again the tests will pass. Since the <literal>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier</literal> plugin adds the tests to the <literal>generated-test-sources</literal> you can actually run those tests from your IDE.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">deploy your app</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Once you&#8217;ve finished your work it&#8217;s time to deploy your change. First merge the branch</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">git checkout master
git merge --no-ff contract-change-pr
git push origin master</programlisting>
<simpara>Then we assume that your CI would run sth like <literal>./mvnw clean deploy</literal> which would publish both the application and the stub artifcats.</simpara>

<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Convention</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>The convention is such that if you have a contract under e.g. <literal>src/test/resources/contract/foo/bar/baz/</literal> and provide the value of the <literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal> property
to <literal>com.example.base</literal> then we will assume that there is a <literal>BarBazBase</literal> class under <literal>com.example.base</literal> package. In other words we take last two parts of package
if they exist and form a class with a <literal>Base</literal> suffix. Takes precedence over <emphasis role="strong">baseClassForTests</emphasis>. Example of usage in the <literal>contracts</literal> closure:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">packageWithBaseClasses = 'com.example.base'</programlisting>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Mapping</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>You can manually map a regular expression of the contract&#8217;s package to fully qualified name of the base class for the matched contract.
Let&#8217;s take a look at the following example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">baseClassForTests = "com.example.FooBase"
baseClassMappings {
	baseClassMapping('.*/com/.*', 'com.example.ComBase')
	baseClassMapping('.*/bar/.*':'com.example.BarBase')

<simpara>Let&#8217;s assume that you have contracts under
 - <literal>src/test/resources/contract/com/</literal>
 - <literal>src/test/resources/contract/foo/</literal></simpara>
<simpara>By providing the <literal>baseClassForTests</literal> we have a fallback in case mapping didn&#8217;t succeed (you could also provide
the <literal>packageWithBaseClasses</literal> as fallback). That way the tests generated from <literal>src/test/resources/contract/com/</literal> contracts

<section xml:id="_spring_cloud_contract_verifier_on_consumer_side_2">
<title>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier on consumer side</title>
<simpara>You can actually use the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier also for the consumer side!
You can use the plugin so that it only converts the contracts and generates the stubs.
To achieve that you need to configure Spring Cloud Contract Verifier plugin in exactly
the same way as in case of provider. You need to copy contracts stored in
<literal>src/test/resources/contracts</literal> and generate WireMock json stubs using:
<literal>mvn generateStubs</literal> command. By default generated WireMock mapping is
stored in directory <literal>target/mappings</literal>. Your project should create from
this generated mappings additional artifact with classifier <literal>stubs</literal> for
easy deploy to maven repository.</simpara>
<simpara>Sample configuration:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.cloud&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;${verifier-plugin.version}&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;executions&gt;
        &lt;execution&gt;
            &lt;goals&gt;
                &lt;goal&gt;convert&lt;/goal&gt;
                &lt;goal&gt;generateStubs&lt;/goal&gt;
            &lt;/goals&gt;
        &lt;/execution&gt;
    &lt;/executions&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>When present, json stubs can be used in consumer automated tests.</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringTestRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureStubRunner
public class LoanApplicationServiceTests {

  @Autowired
  LoanApplicationService service;

  @Test
  public void shouldSuccessfullyApplyForLoan() {
    //given:
 	LoanApplication application =
			new LoanApplication(new Client("12345678901"), 123.123);
    //when:
	LoanApplicationResult loanApplication = service.loanApplication(application);
    // then:
	assertThat(loanApplication.loanApplicationStatus).isEqualTo(LoanApplicationStatus.LOAN_APPLIED);
	assertThat(loanApplication.rejectionReason).isNull();
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Underneath <literal>LoanApplication</literal> makes a call to the <literal>FraudDetection</literal> service. This request is handled by
a WireMock server configured using stubs generated by Spring Cloud Contract Verifier.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_scenarios">
<title>Scenarios</title>
<simpara>It&#8217;s possible to handle scenarios with Spring Cloud Contract Verifier. All you need to do is to stick to proper naming convention while creating your contracts. The convention requires to include order number followed by the underscore.</simpara>
<screen>my_contracts_dir\
  scenario1\
    1_login.groovy
    2_showCart.groovy
    3_logout.groovy</screen>
<simpara>Such tree will cause Spring Cloud Contract Verifier generating WireMock&#8217;s scenario with name <literal>scenario1</literal> and three steps:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>login marked as <literal>Started</literal> pointing to:</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>showCart marked as <literal>Step1</literal> pointing to:</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>logout marked as <literal>Step2</literal> which will close the scenario.</simpara>

</itemizedlist>
<simpara>More details about WireMock scenarios can be found under <link xl:href="http://wiremock.org/stateful-behaviour.html">http://wiremock.org/stateful-behaviour.html</link></simpara>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier will also generate tests with guaranteed order of execution.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_stubs_and_transitive_dependencies">
<title>Stubs and transitive dependencies</title>
<simpara>The Maven and Gradle plugin that we&#8217;re created are adding the tasks that create the stubs jar for you. What can be problematic
is that when reusing the stubs you can by mistake import all of that stub dependencies! When building a Maven artifact
even though you have a couple of different jars, all of them share one pom:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075506-1-stubs.jar
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075506-1-stubs.jar.sha1

├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.pom
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT-stubs.jar
├── ...
└── ...</programlisting>
<simpara>There are three possibilities of working with those dependencies so as not to have any issues with transitive dependencies.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Mark all application dependencies as optional</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>If in the <literal>github-webhook</literal> application we would mark all of our dependencies as optional, when you include the
<literal>github-webhook</literal> stubs in another application (or when that dependency gets downloaded by Stub Runner) then, since
all of the depenencies are optional, they will not get downloaded.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Create a separate artifactid for stubs</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>If you create a separate artifactid then you can set it up in whatever way you wish. For example by having no dependencies at all.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Exclude dependencies on the consumer side</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>As a consumer, if you add the stub dependency to your classpath you can explicitly exclude the unwanted dependencies.</simpara>

<title>Manual Integration Testing</title>
<simpara>The main interface used by the tests is the <literal>org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.messaging.MessageVerifier</literal>.
It defines how to send and receive messages. You can create your own implementation to achieve the
same goal.</simpara>
<simpara>In the a test you can inject a <literal>ContractVerifierMessageExchange</literal> to send and receive messages that follow the contract.
Then add <literal>@AutoConfigureMessageVerifier</literal> to your test, e.g.</simpara>

public static class MessagingContractTests {

<section xml:id="_publisher_side_test_generation">

<simpara>There are 3 main scenarios that we should take into consideration:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Scenario 1: there is no input message that produces an output one. The output message is triggered by a component

<important>
<simpara>The destination passed to <literal>messageFrom</literal> or <literal>sentTo</literal> can have different meanings for different
 messaging implementations. For <emphasis role="strong">Stream</emphasis> and <emphasis role="strong">Integration</emphasis> it&#8217;s first resolved as a <literal>destination</literal> of a channel, and then if
 there is no such <literal>destination</literal> it&#8217;s resolved as a channel name. For <emphasis role="strong">Camel</emphasis> that&#8217;s a certain component (e.x. <literal>jms</literal>).</simpara>

<section xml:id="_stub_runner_boot_with_service_discovery">
<title>Stub Runner Boot with Service Discovery</title>
<simpara>One of the possibilities of using Stub Runner Boot is to use it as a feed of stubs for "smoke-tests". What does it mean?
 Let&#8217;s assume that you don&#8217;t want to deploy 50 microservice to a test environment in order
 to check if your application is working fine. You&#8217;ve already executed a suite of tests during the build process
 but you would also like to ensure that the packaging of your application is fine. What you can do
 is to deploy your application to an environment, start it and run a couple of tests on it to see if
 it&#8217;s working fine. We can call those tests smoke-tests since their idea is to check only a handful
 of testing scenarios.</simpara>
<simpara>The problem with this approach is such that if you&#8217;re doing microservices most likely you&#8217;re
 using a service discovery tool. Stub Runner Boot allows you to solve this issue by starting the
 required stubs and register them in a service discovery tool. Let&#8217;s take a look at an example of
 such a setup with Eureka. Let&#8217;s assume that Eureka was already running.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableStubRunnerServer
@EnableEurekaClient
@AutoConfigureStubRunner
public class StubRunnerBootEurekaExample {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(StubRunnerBootEurekaExample.class, args);
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>As you can see we want to start a Stub Runner Boot server <literal>@EnableStubRunnerServer</literal>, enable Eureka client <literal>@EnableEurekaClient</literal>
and we want to have the stub runner feature turned on <literal>@AutoConfigureStubRunner</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Now let&#8217;s assume that we want to start this application so that the stubs get automatically registered.
 We can do it by running the app <literal>java -jar ${SYSTEM_PROPS} stub-runner-boot-eureka-example.jar</literal> where
 <literal>${SYSTEM_PROPS}</literal> would contain the following list of properties</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">-Dstubrunner.repositoryRoot=http://repo.spring.io/snapshots (1)
-Dstubrunner.cloud.stubbed.discovery.enabled=false (2)
-Dstubrunner.ids=org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:loanIssuance,org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:fraudDetectionServer,org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:bootService (3)
-Dstubrunner.idsToServiceIds.fraudDetectionServer=someNameThatShouldMapFraudDetectionServer (4)

(1) - we tell Stub Runner where all the stubs reside
(2) - we don't want the default behaviour where the discovery service is stubbed. That's why the stub registration will be picked
(3) - we provide a list of stubs to download
(4) - we provide a list of artifactId to serviceId mapping</programlisting>
<simpara>That way your deployed application can send requests to started WireMock servers via the service
discovery. Most likely points 1-3 could be set by default in <literal>application.yml</literal> cause they are not
likely to change. That way you can provide only the list of stubs to download whenever you start
the Stub Runner Boot.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section xml:id="_stubs_per_consumer">
<title>Stubs Per Consumer</title>
<simpara>There are cases in which 2 consumers of the same endpoint want to have 2 different responses.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>This approach also allows you to immediately know which consumer is using which part of your API.
You can remove part of a response that your API produces and you can see which of your autogenerated tests
fails. If none fails then you can safely delete that part of the response cause nobody is using it.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s look at the following example for contract defined for the producer called <literal>producer</literal>.
There are 2 consumers: <literal>foo-consumer</literal> and <literal>bar-consumer</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Consumer <literal>foo-service</literal></emphasis></simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">request {
   url '/foo'
   method GET()
}
response {
    status 200
    body(
       foo: "foo"
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Consumer <literal>bar-service</literal></emphasis></simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">request {
   url '/foo'
   method GET()
}
response {
    status 200
    body(
       bar: "bar"
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>You can&#8217;t produce for the same request 2 different responses. That&#8217;s why you can properly package the
contracts and then profit from the <literal>stubsPerConsumer</literal> feature.</simpara>
<simpara>On the producer side the consumers can have a folder that contains contracts related only to them.
By setting the <literal>stubrunner.stubs-per-consumer</literal> flag to <literal>true</literal> we no longer register all stubs but only those that
correspond to the consumer application&#8217;s name. In other words we&#8217;ll scan the path of every stub and
if it contains the subfolder with name of the consumer in the path only then will it get registered.</simpara>
<simpara>On the <literal>foo</literal> producer side the contracts would look like this</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">.
└── contracts
    ├── bar-consumer
    │   ├── bookReturnedForBar.groovy
    │   └── shouldCallBar.groovy
    └── foo-consumer
        ├── bookReturnedForFoo.groovy
        └── shouldCallFoo.groovy</programlisting>
<simpara>Being the <literal>bar-consumer</literal> consumer you can either set the <literal>spring.application.name</literal> or the <literal>stubrunner.consumer-name</literal> to <literal>bar-consumer</literal>
Or set the test as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">@ContextConfiguration(classes = Config, loader = SpringBootContextLoader)
@SpringBootTest(properties = ["spring.application.name=bar-consumer"])
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = "org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:producerWithMultipleConsumers",
		repositoryRoot = "classpath:m2repo/repository/",
		stubsPerConsumer = true)
@DirtiesContext
class StubRunnerStubsPerConsumerSpec extends Specification {
...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Then only the stubs registered under a path that contains the <literal>bar-consumer</literal> in its name (i.e. those from the
<literal>src/test/resources/contracts/bar-consumer/some/contracts/&#8230;&#8203;</literal> folder) will be allowed to be referenced.</simpara>
<simpara>Or set the consumer name explicitly</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">@ContextConfiguration(classes = Config, loader = SpringBootContextLoader)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = "org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.stubs:producerWithMultipleConsumers",

		consumerName = "foo-consumer",
		stubsPerConsumer = true)
@DirtiesContext
class StubRunnerStubsPerConsumerWithConsumerNameSpec extends Specification {

<simpara>Then only the stubs registered under a path that contains the <literal>foo-consumer</literal> in its name (i.e. those from the

<simpara>You can provide the stubs to download via the <literal>stubrunner.ids</literal> system property. They follow the following pattern:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">groupId:artifactId:version:classifier:port</programlisting>
<simpara><literal>version</literal>, <literal>classifier</literal> and <literal>port</literal> are optional.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>If you don&#8217;t provide the <literal>port</literal> then a random one will be picked</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>If you don&#8217;t provide the <literal>classifier</literal> then the default one will be taken. (NOTE that you can pass an empty classifier like this <literal>groupId:artifactId:version:</literal>)</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>If you don&#8217;t provide the <literal>version</literal> then the <literal>+</literal> will be passed and the latest one will be downloaded</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Where <literal>port</literal> means the port of the WireMock server.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>Starting from version 1.0.4 as a version you can provide a range of versions that you would like
the Stub Runner to take into consideration. You can read more about the <link xl:href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Aether/New_and_Noteworthy#Version_Ranges">Aether versioning ranges here</link>.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>Taken from <link xl:href="http://download.eclipse.org/aether/aether-core/0.9.0/apidocs/org/eclipse/aether/util/version/GenericVersionScheme.html">Aether Docs</link>:</simpara>
<blockquote>
<simpara>This scheme accepts versions of any form, interpreting a version as a sequence of numeric and alphabetic segments. The characters '-', '_', and '.' as well as the mere
transitions from digit to letter and vice versa delimit the version segments. Delimiters are treated as equivalent.</simpara>
<simpara>Numeric segments are compared mathematically, alphabetic segments are compared lexicographically and case-insensitively. However, the following qualifier strings are
recognized and treated specially: "alpha" = "a" &lt; "beta" = "b" &lt; "milestone" = "m" &lt; "cr" = "rc" &lt; "snapshot" &lt; "final" = "ga" &lt; "sp". All of those well-known qualifiers
are considered smaller/older than other strings. An empty segment/string is equivalent to 0.</simpara>
<simpara>In addition to the above mentioned qualifiers, the tokens "min" and "max" may be used as final version segment to denote the smallest/greatest version having a given prefix.
For example, "1.2.min" denotes the smallest version in the 1.2 line, "1.2.max" denotes the greatest version in the 1.2 line. A version range of the form "[M.N.*]" is short for "[M.N.min, M.N.max]".</simpara>
<simpara>Numbers and strings are considered incomparable against each other. Where version segments of different kind would collide, comparison will instead assume that the previous
segments are padded with trailing 0 or "ga" segments, respectively, until the kind mismatch is resolved, e.g. "1-alpha" = "1.0.0-alpha" &lt; "1.0.1-ga" = "1.0.1".</simpara>

<title>Stub Runner for Messaging</title>
<simpara>Stub Runner has the functionality to run the published stubs in memory. It can integrate with the following frameworks out of the box</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Spring Integration</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Stream</simpara>

<simpara>Spring AMQP</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>It also provides points of entry to integrate with any other solution on the market.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>If you have multiple frameworks on the classpath Stub Runner will need to
define which one should be used. Let&#8217;s assume that you have both AMQP, Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Integration
on the classpath. Then you need to set <literal>stubrunner.stream.enabled=false</literal> and <literal>stubrunner.integration.enabled=false</literal>.
That way the only remaining framework is Spring AMQP.</simpara>

<title>Stub Runner Spring AMQP</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier Stub Runner&#8217;s messaging module provides an easy way to integrate with Spring AMQP&#8217;s Rabbit Template.
For the provided artifacts it will automatically download the stubs and register the required
routes.</simpara>
<simpara>The integration tries to work standalone, that is without interaction with a running RabbitMQ message broker.
It expects a <literal>RabbitTemplate</literal> on the application context and uses it as a spring boot test <literal>@SpyBean</literal>.
Thus it can use the mockito spy functionality to verify and introspect messages sent by the application.</simpara>
<simpara>On the message consumer side, it considers all <literal>@RabbitListener</literal> annotated endpoints as well as all `SimpleMessageListenerContainer`s on the application context.</simpara>
<simpara>As messages are usually sent to exchanges in AMQP the message contract contains the exchange name as the destination.
Message listeners on the other side are bound to queues. Bindings connect an exchange to a queue.
If message contracts are triggered the Spring AMQP stub runner integration will look for bindings on the application context that match this exchange.
Then it collects the queues from the Spring exchanges and tries to find messages listeners bound to these queues.
The message is triggered to all matching message listeners.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_adding_it_to_the_project_4">

<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">stubTrigger.trigger("contract-test.person.created.event")</programlisting>

<title>Contract DSL</title>
<important>
<simpara>Remember that inside the contract file you have to provide the fully qualified name to
the <literal>Contract</literal> class and the <literal>make</literal> static import i.e. <literal>org.springframework.cloud.spec.Contract.make { &#8230;&#8203; }</literal>.
You can also provide an import to the <literal>Contract</literal> class <literal>import org.springframework.cloud.spec.Contract</literal> and then call
  <literal>Contract.make { &#8230;&#8203; }</literal></simpara>
</important>
<simpara>Contract DSL is written in Groovy, but don&#8217;t be alarmed if you didn&#8217;t use Groovy before. Knowledge of the language is not really needed as our DSL uses only
a tiny subset of it (namely literals, method calls and closures). What&#8217;s more the DSL is designed to be programmer-readable without any knowledge of the DSL itself -
 it&#8217;s statically typed.</simpara>

<title>Limitations</title>
<warning>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract Verifier doesn&#8217;t support XML properly. Please use JSON or help us implement this feature.</simpara>
</warning>
<warning>
<simpara>The support for the verification of size of JSON arrays is experimental. If you want to turn it on please provide
the value of a system property <literal>spring.cloud.contract.verifier.assert.size</literal> equal to <literal>true</literal>. By default this feature is set to
<literal>false</literal>. You can also provide the <literal>assertJsonSize</literal> property in the plugin configuration.</simpara>
</warning>
<warning>
<simpara>Due to the fact that JSON structure can have any form it&#8217;s sometimes impossible to parse it properly when using
the <literal>value(consumer(&#8230;&#8203;), producer(&#8230;&#8203;))</literal> notation when using that in GString. That&#8217;s why we highly recommend using the

<important>
<simpara>Please ensure that the name doesn&#8217;t contain any characters that will make the generated test

<section xml:id="_dynamic_properties">
<title>Dynamic properties</title>
<simpara>The contract can contain some dynamic properties - timestamps / ids etc. You don&#8217;t want to enforce the consumers to stub their
clocks to always return the same value of time so that it gets matched by the stub. That&#8217;s why we allow you to provide the dynamic
parts in your contracts in two ways. One is to pass them directly in the
body and one to set them in a separate section called <literal>testMatchers</literal> and <literal>stubMatchers</literal>.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_dynamic_properties_inside_the_body">
<title>Dynamic properties inside the body</title>
<simpara>You can set the properties inside the body either via the <literal>value</literal> method</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">value(consumer(...), producer(...))
value(c(...), p(...))
value(stub(...), test(...))
value(client(...), server(...))</programlisting>

$(c(...), p(...))
$(stub(...), test(...))
$(client(...), server(...))</programlisting>
<simpara>All of the aforementioned approaches are equal. That means that <literal>stub</literal> and <literal>client</literal> methods are aliases over the <literal>consumer</literal>
method. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at what we can do with those values in the subsequent sections.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_regular_expressions">
<title>Regular expressions</title>
<simpara>You can use regular expressions to write your requests in Contract DSL. It is particularly useful when you want to indicate that a given response

for your test and your server side tests.</simpara>

<simpara>You can also provide only one side of the communication using a regular expression. If you do that then automatically we&#8217;ll
provide the generated string that matches the provided regular expression. For example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
	request {
		method 'PUT'
		url value(consumer(regex('/foo/[0-9]{5}')))

		])
		headers {
			header('header', $(consumer(regex('application\\/vnd\\.fraud\\.v1\\+json;.*'))))
		}
	}
	response {

		body([
			responseElement: $(producer(regex('[0-9]{7}')))
		])
		headers {
			contentType("application/vnd.fraud.v1+json")
		}
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>In this example for request and response the opposite side of the communication will have the respective data generated.</simpara>

<simpara>By wrapping a part of the body with the <literal>optional()</literal> method you are in fact creating a regular expression that should be present 0 or more times.</simpara>

<important>
<simpara>You can&#8217;t use both a String and <literal>execute</literal> to perform concatenation. E.g. calling
<literal>header('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + execute('authToken()'))</literal> will lead to improper results.
To make this work just call <literal>header('Authorization', execute('authToken()'))</literal> and ensure that
the <literal>authToken()</literal> method returns everything that you need.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>The type of the object read from the JSON can be one of the followings depending on the
JSON path:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>String</literal> if you point to a <literal>String</literal> value in a JSON</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>JSONArray</literal> if you point to a <literal>List</literal> in a JSON</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Map</literal> if you point to a <literal>Map</literal> in a JSON</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>proper <literal>Number</literal> if you point to <literal>Integer</literal>, <literal>Double</literal> etc. in a JSON</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>Boolean</literal> if you point to a <literal>Boolean</literal> in a JSON</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>In the request part of the contract you can specify that the <literal>body</literal> should be
taken from a method.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>You have to provide both the consumer and the producer side
and the <literal>execute</literal> part can be applied for the whole body. Not for parts of it!</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">Contract contractDsl = Contract.make {

<simpara>This will result in calling the <literal>hashCode()</literal> method in the request body.
It would more or less like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// given:
 MockMvcRequestSpecification request = given()
   .body(hashCode());

// when:

<section xml:id="_referencing_request_from_response">
<title>Referencing request from response</title>
<simpara>The best situation is to provide fixed values but sometimes you need to reference a request in your response.
In order to do this you can profit from the <literal>fromRequest()</literal> method that allows you to reference a bunch
of elements from the HTTP request. You can use the following options:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>fromRequest().url()</literal> - return the request URL</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>fromRequest().query(String key)</literal> - return the first query parameter with a given name</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>fromRequest().query(String key, int index)</literal> - return the nth query parameter with a given name</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>fromRequest().header(String key)</literal> - return the first header with a given name</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>fromRequest().header(String key, int index)</literal> - return the nth header with a given name</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>fromRequest().body()</literal> - return the full request body</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>fromRequest().body(String jsonPath)</literal> - return the element from the request that matches the JSON Path</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s take a look at the following contract</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">Contract contractDsl = Contract.make {
	request {
		method 'GET'
		url('/api/v1/xxxx') {
			queryParameters {

				responseBaz: fromRequest().body('$.baz'),
				responseBaz2: "Bla bla ${fromRequest().body('$.foo')} bla bla"
		)
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Running a JUnit test generation will lead in creation of a test looking more or less like this</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">// given:
 MockMvcRequestSpecification request = given()
   .header("Authorization", "secret")

 assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("responseBaz2").isEqualTo("Bla bla bar bla bla");
 assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("param").isEqualTo("bar");
 assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("authorization").isEqualTo("secret");</programlisting>
<simpara>As you can see elements from the request have been properly referenced in the response.</simpara>
<simpara>The generated WireMock stub will look more or less like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
  "request" : {
    "urlPath" : "/api/v1/xxxx",
    "method" : "POST",
    "headers" : {
      "Authorization" : {
        "equalTo" : "secret2"
      }
    },
    "queryParameters" : {
      "foo" : {
        "equalTo" : "bar2"
      }
    },
    "bodyPatterns" : [ {
      "matchesJsonPath" : "$[?(@.baz == 5)]"
    }, {
      "matchesJsonPath" : "$[?(@.foo == 'bar')]"
    } ]
  },
  "response" : {
    "status" : 200,
    "body" : "{\"url\":\"{{{request.url}}}\",\"param\":\"{{{request.query.foo.[0]}}}\",\"paramIndex\":\"{{{request.query.foo.[1]}}}\",\"authorization\":\"{{{request.headers.Authorization.[0]}}}\",\"authorization2\":\"{{{request.headers.Authorization.[1]}}}\",\"fullBody\":\"{{{escapejsonbody}}}\",\"responseFoo\":\"{{{jsonpath this '$.foo'}}}\",\"responseBaz\":{{{jsonpath this '$.baz'}}} ,\"responseBaz2\":\"Bla bla {{{jsonpath this '$.foo'}}} bla bla\"}",
    "headers" : {
      "Authorization" : "{{{request.headers.Authorization.[0]}}}"
    },
    "transformers" : [ "response-template" ]
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>So sending a request as the one presented in the <literal>request</literal> part of the contract will lead in sending the following
response body</simpara>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
  "url" : "/api/v1/xxxx?foo=bar&amp;foo=bar2",
  "param" : "bar",

  "fullBody" : "{\"foo\":\"bar\",\"baz\":5}",
  "responseFoo" : "bar",
  "responseBaz" : 5,
  "responseBaz2" : "Bla bla bar bla bla"
}</programlisting>
<important>
<simpara>This feature will work only with WireMock having version greater or equal to 2.5.1. We&#8217;re using WireMock&#8217;s
<literal>response-template</literal> response transformer. It&#8217;s using Handlebars to convert the Mustache <literal>{{{ }}}</literal> templates into
proper values. Additionally we&#8217;re registering 2 helper functions. <literal>escapejsonbody</literal> - that escapes the request
body in a format that can be embedded in a JSON. Another is <literal>jsonpath</literal> that for a given parameter knows how to
find an object in the request body.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_dynamic_properties_in_matchers_sections">
<title>Dynamic properties in matchers sections</title>
<simpara>If you&#8217;ve been working with <link xl:href="https://docs.pact.io/">Pact</link> this might seem familiar. Quite a few users
are used to having a separation between the body and setting dynamic parts of your contract.</simpara>
<simpara>That&#8217;s why you can profit from two separate sections. One is called <literal>stubMatchers</literal> where you can
define the dynamic values that should end up in a stub. You can set it in the <literal>request</literal> or <literal>inputMessage</literal>
part of your contract. The other is called <literal>testMatchers</literal> which is present in the <literal>response</literal> or
<literal>outputMessage</literal> side of the contract.</simpara>
<simpara>Currently we support only JSON Path based matchers with the following matching possibilities.
For <literal>stubMatchers</literal>:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>byEquality()</literal> - the value taken from the response via the provided JSON Path needs
to be equal to the provided value in the contract</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>byType()</literal> - the value taken from the response via the provided JSON Path needs to
be of the same type as the type defined in the body of the response in the contract.
<literal>byType</literal> can take a closure where you can set <literal>minOccurrence</literal> and <literal>maxOccurrence</literal>.
That way you can assert on the size of the flattened collection. To check the size
of an unflattened collection, use a custom method via <literal>byCommand(&#8230;&#8203;)</literal> testMatcher.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><literal>byCommand(&#8230;&#8203;)</literal> - the value taken from the response via the provided JSON Path will be
passed as an input to the custom method that you&#8217;re providing. E.g. <literal>byCommand('foo($it)')</literal>
will result in calling a <literal>foo</literal> method to which the value matching the JSON Path will get
 passed.</simpara>

<simpara>In this example we&#8217;re providing the dynamic portions of the contract in the matchers sections.
 For the request part you can see that for all fields but <literal>valueWithoutAMatcher</literal> we&#8217;re setting
 explicitly the values of regular expressions we&#8217;d like the stub to contain. For the <literal>valueWithoutAMatcher</literal>
 the verification will take place in the same way as without the usage of matchers - the test
 will perform an equality check in this case.</simpara>
<simpara>For the response side in the <literal>testMatchers</literal> section we&#8217;re defining all the dynamic parts
 in a similar manner. The only difference is that we have the <literal>byType</literal> matchers too. In that
 case we&#8217;re checking 4 fields in the way that we&#8217;re verifying whether the response from the test
 has a value whose JSON path matching the given field is of the same type as the one defined in the response body and:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>for <literal>$.valueWithTypeMatch</literal> - we&#8217;re just checking the whether the type is the same</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>for <literal>$.valueWithMin</literal> - we&#8217;re checking the type and assert if the size is greater or equal to the min occurrence</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>for <literal>$.valueWithMax</literal> - we&#8217;re checking the type and assert if the size is smaller or equal to the max occurrence</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>for <literal>$.valueWithMinMax</literal> - we&#8217;re checking the type and assert if the size is between the min and max occurrence</simpara>

<simpara>The resulting test would look more or less like this (note that we&#8217;re separating the autogenerated
assertions and the one from matchers with an <literal>and</literal> section):</simpara>

<simpara>If you use a <literal>matcher</literal> then the part of the request / response that the <literal>matcher</literal> is addressing

<simpara>Let&#8217;s look at the following example:</simpara>

<simpara>This will lead in creating the following test (showing just the assertion section)</simpara>

<simpara>As you can see the assertion is malformed. That&#8217;s because only the first element of the array got asserted.

<simpara>Notice that for the contract that has the <literal>name</literal> field the generated test method is named
<literal>validate_should_post_a_user</literal>. For the one that doesn&#8217;t have the name it&#8217;s called
<literal>validate_withList_1</literal>. It corresponds to the name of the file <literal>WithList.groovy</literal> and the
index of the contract in the list.</simpara>
<simpara>The generated stubs will look like this</simpara>
<screen>should post a user.json
1_WithList.json</screen>
<simpara>As you can see the first file got the <literal>name</literal> parameter from the contract. The second
got the name of the contract file <literal>WithList.groovy</literal> prefixed with the index (in this case
contract had index <literal>1</literal> in the list of contracts in the file).</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>As you can see it&#8217;s much better if you name your contracts since then your tests
 are far more meaningful.</simpara>

the test and stubs generation. It&#8217;s really easy to add your own implementation

tests for other languages) and you can do the same for stubs generation (you can generate

<chapter xml:id="_spring_cloud_contract_wiremock">
<title>Spring Cloud Contract WireMock</title>
<simpara>Modules giving you the possibility to use
<link xl:href="http://wiremock.org">WireMock</link> with different servers by using the
"ambient" server embedded in a Spring Boot application. Check out the
<link xl:href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/1.0.x/samples">samples</link>
for more details.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>The Spring Cloud Release Train BOM imports <literal>spring-cloud-contract-dependencies</literal>
 which in turn has exclusions for the dependencies needed by WireMock. This might lead to a situation that
 even if you&#8217;re not using Spring Cloud Contract then your dependencies will be influenced
 anyways.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>If you have a Spring Boot application that uses Tomcat as an embedded
server, for example (the default with <literal>spring-boot-starter-web</literal>), then
you can simply add <literal>spring-cloud-contract-wiremock</literal> to your classpath
and add <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> in order to be able to use Wiremock
in your tests. Wiremock runs as a stub server and you can register
stub behaviour using a Java API or via static JSON declarations as
part of your test. Here&#8217;s a simple example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@AutoConfigureWireMock(port = 0)
public class WiremockForDocsTests {
	// A service that calls out over HTTP
	@Autowired private Service service;

	// Using the WireMock APIs in the normal way:
	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		// Stubbing WireMock
		stubFor(get(urlEqualTo("/resource"))
				.willReturn(aResponse().withHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain").withBody("Hello World!")));
		// We're asserting if WireMock responded properly
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World!");
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>To start the stub server on a different port use <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock(port=9999)</literal> (for example), and for a random port use the value 0. The stub server port will be bindable in the test application context as "wiremock.server.port". Using <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> adds a bean of type <literal>WiremockConfiguration</literal> to your test application context, where it will be cached in between methods and classes having the same context, just like for normal Spring integration tests.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_registering_stubs_automatically">
<title>Registering Stubs Automatically</title>
<simpara>If you use <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> then it will register WireMock
JSON stubs from the file system or classpath, by default from
<literal>file:src/test/resources/mappings</literal>. You can customize the locations
using the <literal>stubs</literal> attribute in the annotation, which can be a resource
pattern (ant-style) or a directory, in which case <literal><emphasis role="strong">*/</emphasis>.json</literal> is
appended. Example:</simpara>
<screen>@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureWireMock(stubs="classpath:/stubs")
public class WiremockImportApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private Service service;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World!");
	}

}</screen>
<note>
<simpara>Actually WireMock always loads mappings from
<literal>src/test/resources/mappings</literal> <emphasis role="strong">as well as</emphasis> the custom locations in the
stubs attribute. To change this behaviour you have to also specify a
files root as described next.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_using_files_to_specify_the_stub_bodies">
<title>Using Files to Specify the Stub Bodies</title>
<simpara>WireMock can read response bodies from files on the classpath or file
system. In that case you will see in the JSON DSL that the response
has a "bodyFileName" instead of a (literal) "body". The files are
resolved relative to a root directory <literal>src/test/resources/__files</literal> by
default. To customize this location you can set the <literal>files</literal> attribute
in the <literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> annotation to the location of the
parent directory (i.e. the place <literal>__files</literal> is a
subdirectory). You can use Spring resource notation to refer to
<literal>file:&#8230;&#8203;</literal> or <literal>classpath:&#8230;&#8203;</literal> locations (but generic URLs are not
supported). A list of values can be given and WireMock will resolve
the first file that exists when it needs to find a response body.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>when you configure the <literal>files</literal> root, then it affects the
automatic loading of stubs as well (they come from the root location
in a subdirectory called "mappings"). The value of <literal>files</literal> has no
effect on the stubs loaded explicitly from the <literal>stubs</literal> attribute.</simpara>
</note>
</section>
<section xml:id="_alternative_using_junit_rules">
<title>Alternative: Using JUnit Rules</title>
<simpara>For a more conventional WireMock experience, using JUnit <literal>@Rules</literal> to
start and stop the server, just use the <literal>WireMockSpring</literal> convenience
class to obtain an <literal>Options</literal> instance:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
public class WiremockForDocsClassRuleTests {

	// Start WireMock on some dynamic port
	// for some reason `dynamicPort()` is not working properly
	@ClassRule
	public static WireMockClassRule wiremock = new WireMockClassRule(
			WireMockSpring.options().dynamicPort());
	// A service that calls out over HTTP to localhost:${wiremock.port}
	@Autowired
	private Service service;

	// Using the WireMock APIs in the normal way:
	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		// Stubbing WireMock
		wiremock.stubFor(get(urlEqualTo("/resource"))
				.willReturn(aResponse().withHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain").withBody("Hello World!")));
		// We're asserting if WireMock responded properly
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World!");
	}

}</programlisting>
<simpara>The use <literal>@ClassRule</literal> means that the server will shut down after all the methods in this class.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_relaxed_ssl_validation_for_rest_template">
<title>Relaxed SSL Validation for Rest Template</title>
<simpara>WireMock allows you to stub a "secure" server with an "https" URL protocol. If your application wants to
contact that stub server in an integration test, then it will find that the SSL certificates are not
valid (it&#8217;s the usual problem with self-installed certificates). The best option is often to just
re-configure the client to use "http", but if that&#8217;s not open to you then you can ask Spring to configure
an HTTP client that ignores SSL validation errors (just for tests).</simpara>
<simpara>To make this work with minimum fuss you need to be using the Spring Boot <literal>RestTemplateBuilder</literal> in your app,
e.g.</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Bean
public RestTemplate restTemplate(RestTemplateBuilder builder) {
	return builder.build();
}</programlisting>
<simpara>This is because the builder is passed through callbacks to initalize it, so the SSL validation can be set up
in the client at that point. This will happen automatically in your test if you are using the
<literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock</literal> annotation (or the stub runner). If you are using the JUnit <literal>@Rule</literal> approach you need
to add the <literal>@AutoConfigureHttpClient</literal> annotation as well:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest("app.baseUrl=https://localhost:6443")
@AutoConfigureHttpClient
public class WiremockHttpsServerApplicationTests {

	@ClassRule
	public static WireMockClassRule wiremock = new WireMockClassRule(
			WireMockSpring.options().httpsPort(6443));
...
}</programlisting>
<simpara>If you are using <literal>spring-boot-starter-test</literal> then you will have the Apache HTTP client on the classpath and it will
be selected by the <literal>RestTemplateBuilder</literal> and configured to ignore SSL errors. If you are using the default <literal>java.net</literal>
client you don&#8217;t need the annotation (but it won&#8217;t do any harm). There is no support currently for other clients, but
it may be added in future releases.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_wiremock_and_spring_mvc_mocks">
<title>WireMock and Spring MVC Mocks</title>
<simpara>Spring Cloud Contract provides a convenience class that can load JSON WireMock stubs into a
Spring <literal>MockRestServiceServer</literal>. Here&#8217;s an example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.NONE)
public class WiremockForDocsMockServerApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private RestTemplate restTemplate;

	@Autowired
	private Service service;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		// will read stubs classpath
		MockRestServiceServer server = WireMockRestServiceServer.with(this.restTemplate)
				.baseUrl("http://example.org").stubs("classpath:/stubs/resource.json")
				.build();
		// We're asserting if WireMock responded properly
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World");
		server.verify();
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>baseUrl</literal> is prepended to all mock calls, and the <literal>stubs()</literal>
method takes a stub path resource pattern as an argument. So in this
example the stub defined at <literal>/stubs/resource.json</literal> is loaded into the
mock server, so if the <literal>RestTemplate</literal> is asked to visit
<literal><link xl:href="http://example.org/">http://example.org/</link></literal> it will get the responses as declared
there. More than one stub pattern can be specified, and each one can
be a directory (for a recursive list of all ".json"), or a fixed
filename (like in the example above) or an ant-style pattern. The JSON
format is the normal WireMock format which you can read about in the
WireMock website.</simpara>
<simpara>Currently we support Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow as Spring Boot
embedded servers, and Wiremock itself has "native" support for a
particular version of Jetty (currently 9.2). To use the native Jetty
you need to add the native wiremock dependencies and exclude the
Spring Boot container if there is one.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_generating_stubs_using_restdocs">
<title>Generating Stubs using RestDocs</title>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-restdocs">Spring RestDocs</link> can be
used to generate documentation (e.g. in asciidoctor format) for an
HTTP API with Spring MockMvc or Rest Assured. At the same time as you
generate documentation for your API, you can also generate WireMock
stubs, by using Spring Cloud Contract WireMock. Just write your normal
RestDocs test cases and use <literal>@AutoConfigureRestDocs</literal> to have stubs
automatically in the restdocs output directory. For example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureRestDocs(outputDir = "target/snippets")
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
public class ApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private MockMvc mockMvc;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		mockMvc.perform(get("/resource"))
				.andExpect(content().string("Hello World"))
				.andDo(document("resource"));
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>From this test will be generated a WireMock stub at
"target/snippets/stubs/resource.json". It matches all GET requests to
the "/resource" path.</simpara>
<simpara>Without any additional configuration this will create a stub with a
request matcher for the HTTP method and all headers except "host" and
"content-length". To match the request more precisely, for example to
match the body of a POST or PUT, we need to explicitly create a
request matcher. This will do two things: 1) create a stub that only
matches the way you specify, 2) assert that the request in the test
case also matches the same conditions.</simpara>
<simpara>The main entry point for this is <literal>WireMockRestDocs.verify()</literal> which can
be used as a substitute for the <literal>document()</literal> convenience method. For
example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureRestDocs(outputDir = "target/snippets")
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
public class ApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private MockMvc mockMvc;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		mockMvc.perform(post("/resource")
                .content("{\"id\":\"123456\",\"message\":\"Hello World\"}"))
				.andExpect(status().isOk())
				.andDo(verify().jsonPath("$.id")
                        .stub("resource"));
	}
}</programlisting>
<simpara>So this contract is saying: any valid POST with an "id" field will get
back an the same response as in this test. You can chain together
calls to <literal>.jsonPath()</literal> to add additional matchers. The
<link xl:href="https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath">JayWay documentation</link> can help you
to get up to speed with JSON Path if it is unfamiliar to you.</simpara>
<simpara>Instead of the <literal>jsonPath</literal> and <literal>contentType</literal> convenience methods, you
can also use the WireMock APIs to verify the request matches the
created stub. Example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">@Test
public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
	mockMvc.perform(post("/resource")
               .content("{\"id\":\"123456\",\"message\":\"Hello World\"}"))
			.andExpect(status().isOk())
			.andDo(verify()
					.wiremock(WireMock.post(
						urlPathEquals("/resource"))
						.withRequestBody(matchingJsonPath("$.id"))
                       .stub("post-resource"));
}</programlisting>
<simpara>The WireMock API is rich - you can match headers, query parameters,
and request body by regex as well as by json path - so this can useful
to create stubs with a wider range of parameters. The above example
will generate a stub something like this:</simpara>
<formalpara>
<title>post-resource.json</title>
<para>
<programlisting language="json" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
  "request" : {
    "url" : "/resource",
    "method" : "POST",
    "bodyPatterns" : [ {
      "matchesJsonPath" : "$.id"
    }]
  },
  "response" : {
    "status" : 200,
    "body" : "Hello World",
    "headers" : {
      "X-Application-Context" : "application:-1",
      "Content-Type" : "text/plain"
    }
  }
}</programlisting>
</para>
</formalpara>
<note>
<simpara>You can use either the <literal>wiremock()</literal> method or the <literal>jsonPath()</literal>
and <literal>contentType()</literal> methods to create request matchers, but not both.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>On the consumer side, you can make the <literal>resource.json</literal> generated above
available on the classpath (by <link xl:href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_publishing_stubs_as_jars">publishing stubs as JARs</link> for example).
After that, you can create a stub using WireMock in a
number of different ways, including as described above using
<literal>@AutoConfigureWireMock(stubs="classpath:resource.json")</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_generating_contracts_using_restdocs">
<title>Generating Contracts using RestDocs</title>
<simpara>Another thing that can be generated with Spring RestDocs is the Spring Cloud
Contract DSL file and documentation. If you combine that with Spring Cloud
WireMock then you&#8217;re getting both the contracts and stubs.</simpara>
<simpara>Why would you want to use this feature? Some people in the community asked questions
about situation in which they would like to move to DSL based contract definition
but they already have a lot of Spring MVC tests. Using this feature allows you to generate
the contract files that you can later modify and move to proper folders so that the
plugin picks them up.</simpara>
<tip>
<simpara>You might wonder why this functionality is in the WireMock module.
Come to think of it, it does make sense since it makes little sense to generate
only contracts and not generate the stubs. That&#8217;s why we suggest to do both.</simpara>
</tip>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s imagine the following test:</simpara>
<programlisting language="java" linenumbering="unnumbered">		this.mockMvc.perform(post("/foo")
					.accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_PDF)
					.accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
					.contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
					.content("{\"foo\": 23 }"))
				.andExpect(status().isOk())
				.andExpect(content().string("bar"))
				// first WireMock
				.andDo(WireMockRestDocs.verify()
						.jsonPath("$[?(@.foo &gt;= 20)]")
						.contentType(MediaType.valueOf("application/json"))
						.stub("shouldGrantABeerIfOldEnough"))
				// then Contract DSL documentation
				.andDo(document("index", SpringCloudContractRestDocs.dslContract()));</programlisting>
<simpara>This will lead in the creation of the stub as presented in the previous
section, contract will get generated and a documentation file too.</simpara>
<simpara>The contract will be called <literal>index.groovy</literal> and look more like this.</simpara>
<programlisting language="groovy" linenumbering="unnumbered">import org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract

Contract.make {
    request {
        method 'POST'
        url '/foo'
        body('''
            {"foo": 23 }
        ''')
        headers {
            header('''Accept''', '''application/json''')
            header('''Content-Type''', '''application/json''')
        }
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body('''
        bar
        ''')
        headers {
            header('''Content-Type''', '''application/json;charset=UTF-8''')
            header('''Content-Length''', '''3''')
        }
        testMatchers {
            jsonPath('$[?(@.foo &gt;= 20)]', byType())
        }
    }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>the generated document (example for Asciidoc) will contain a formatted contract
(the location of this file would be <literal>index/dsl-contract.adoc</literal>).</simpara>
