== Messaging
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Spring Cloud Contract lets you verify applications that use messaging as a
means of communication. All of the integrations shown in this document work with Spring,
but you can also create one of your own and use that.

[[contract-dsl-messaging-top-level]]
=== Messaging DSL Top-level Elements

The DSL for messaging looks a little bit different than the one that focuses on HTTP. The
following sections explain the differences:

* <<contract-dsl-output-triggered-method>>
* <<contract-dsl-consumer-producer>>
* <<contract-dsl-messaging-common>>

[[contract-dsl-output-triggered-method]]
==== Output Triggered by a Method

The output message can be triggered by calling a method (such as a `Scheduler` when a contract was
started and when a message was sent), as shown in the following example:

====
[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Groovy
----
include::{tests_path}/samples-messaging-integration/src/test/groovy/com/example/IntegrationMessagingApplicationSpec.groovy[tags=method_trigger,indent=0]
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.YAML
----
include::{verifier_core_path}/src/test/resources/yml/contract_message_method.yml[indent=0]
----
====

In the previous example case, the output message is sent to `output` if a method called
`bookReturnedTriggered` is invoked. On the message publisher's side, we generate a
test that calls that method to trigger the message. On the consumer side, you can use
`some_label` to trigger the message.


[[contract-dsl-consumer-producer]]
==== Consumer/Producer

IMPORTANT: This section is valid only for the Groovy DSL.

In HTTP, you have a notion of `client`/`stub and `server`/`test` notation. You can also
use those paradigms in messaging. In addition, Spring Cloud Contract Verifier also
provides the `consumer` and `producer` methods
(note that you can use either `$` or `value` methods to provide `consumer` and `producer`
parts).

[[contract-dsl-messaging-common]]
==== Common

In the `input` or `outputMessage` section, you can call `assertThat` with the name
of a `method` (for example, `assertThatMessageIsOnTheQueue()`) that you have defined in the
base class or in a static import. Spring Cloud Contract runs that method
in the generated test.

[[features-messaging-integrations]]
=== Integrations

You can use one of the following integration configurations:

* Apache Camel
* Spring Integration
* Spring Cloud Stream
* Spring JMS

Since we use Spring Boot, if you have added one of these libraries to the classpath, all
the messaging configuration is automatically set up.

IMPORTANT: Remember to put `@AutoConfigureMessageVerifier` on the base class of your
generated tests. Otherwise, the messaging part of Spring Cloud Contract does not
work.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
If you want to use Spring Cloud Stream, remember to add a test dependency on
`org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-stream`, as  follows:

====
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream</artifactId>
    <type>test-jar</type>
    <scope>test</scope>
    <classifier>test-binder</classifier>
</dependency>
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
testImplementation(group: 'org.springframework.cloud', name: 'spring-cloud-stream', classifier: 'test-binder')
----
====
=====

[[features-messaging-manual]]
==== Manual Integration Testing

The main interface used by the tests is
`org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.messaging.MessageVerifierSender` and `org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.messaging.MessageVerifierReceiver`.
It defines how to send and receive messages.

In a test, you can inject a `ContractVerifierMessageExchange` to send and receive
messages that follow the contract. Then add `@AutoConfigureMessageVerifier` to your test.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@RunWith(SpringTestRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMessageVerifier
public static class MessagingContractTests {

  @Autowired
  private MessageVerifier verifier;
  ...
}
----
====

NOTE: If your tests require stubs as well, then `@AutoConfigureStubRunner` includes the
messaging configuration, so you only need the one annotation.

[[features-messaging-test-generation]]
=== Producer Side  Messaging Test Generation

Having the `input` or `outputMessage` sections in your DSL results in creation of tests
on the publisher's side. By default, JUnit 4 tests are created. However, there is also a
possibility to create JUnit 5, TestNG, or Spock tests.

IMPORTANT: The destination passed to `messageFrom` or `sentTo` can have different
meanings for different messaging implementations. For Stream and Integration, it is
first resolved as a `destination` of a channel. Then, if there is no such `destination`,
it is resolved as a channel name. For Camel, that's a certain component (for example,
`jms`).

Consider the following contract:

=====
[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Groovy
----
include::{verifier_core_path}/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_method_dsl]
----

[source,yml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.YAML
[source,yml,indent=0]
----
include::{verifier_core_path}/src/test/resources/yml/contract_message_scenario1.yml[indent=0]
----
=====

For the preceding example, the following test would be created:

====
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.JUnit
----
include::{verifier_core_path}/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_method_junit_test]
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Spock
----
include::{verifier_core_path}/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_method_test]
----
====

[[features-messaging-consumer]]
=== Consumer Stub Generation

Unlike in the HTTP part, in messaging, we need to publish the contract definition inside the JAR with
a stub. Then it is parsed on the consumer side, and proper stubbed routes are created.

IMPORTANT: If you have multiple frameworks on the classpath, Stub Runner needs to
define which one should be used. Assume that you have AMQP, Spring Cloud Stream, and Spring Integration
on the classpath and that you want to use Spring AMQP. Then you need to set
`stubrunner.stream.enabled=false` and `stubrunner.integration.enabled=false`.
That way, the only remaining framework is Spring AMQP.

[[features-messaging-stub-triggering]]
==== Stub triggering

To trigger a message, use the `StubTrigger` interface, as the following example shows:

====
[source,groovy]
----
include::{stubrunner_core_path}/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/StubTrigger.java[lines=16..-1]
----
====

For convenience, the `StubFinder` interface extends `StubTrigger`, so you need only one
or the other in your tests.

`StubTrigger` gives you the following options to trigger a message:

* <<features-messaging-trigger-label>>
* <<features-messaging-trigger-group-artifact-ids>>
* <<features-messaging-trigger-artifact-ids>>
* <<features-messaging-trigger-all-messages>>

[[features-messaging-trigger-label]]
==== Trigger by Label

The following example shows how to trigger a message with a label:

====
[source,groovy]
----
include::{tests_path}/spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner-stream/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/messaging/stream/StreamStubRunnerSpec.groovy[tags=client_trigger,indent=0]
----
====

[[features-messaging-trigger-group-artifact-ids]]
==== Trigger by Group and Artifact IDs

The following example shows how to trigger a message by group and artifact IDs:

====
[source,groovy]
----
include::{tests_path}/spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner-stream/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/messaging/stream/StreamStubRunnerSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_group_artifact,indent=0]
----
====

[[features-messaging-trigger-artifact-ids]]
==== Trigger by Artifact IDs

The following example shows how to trigger a message from artifact IDs:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{tests_path}/spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner-stream/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/messaging/stream/StreamStubRunnerSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_artifact,indent=0]
----

[[features-messaging-trigger-all-messages]]
==== Trigger All Messages

The following example shows how to trigger all messages:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{tests_path}/spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner-stream/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/messaging/stream/StreamStubRunnerSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_all,indent=0]
----

:output_name: jms:output

[[features-messaging-stub-runner-camel]]
=== Consumer Side Messaging With Apache Camel

Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner's messaging module gives you an easy way to integrate with Apache Camel.
For the provided artifacts, it automatically downloads the stubs and registers the required
routes.

[[features-messaging-stub-runner-camel-adding]]
==== Adding Apache Camel to the Project

You can have both Apache Camel and Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner on the classpath.
Remember to annotate your test class with `@AutoConfigureStubRunner`.

[[features-messaging-stub-runner-camel-disabling]]
==== Disabling the Functionality

If you need to disable this functionality, set the `stubrunner.camel.enabled=false` property.

[[features-messaging-stub-runner-camel-example]]
==== Examples

Assume that we have the following Maven repository with deployed stubs for the
`camelService` application:

====
[source,bash,indent=0]
----
└── .m2
    └── repository
        └── io
            └── codearte
                └── accurest
                    └── stubs
                        └── camelService
                            ├── 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
                            │   ├── camelService-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.pom
                            │   ├── camelService-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-stubs.jar
                            │   └── maven-metadata-local.xml
                            └── maven-metadata-local.xml
----
====

Further, assume that the stubs contain the following structure:

====
[source,bash,indent=0]
----
├── META-INF
│   └── MANIFEST.MF
└── repository
    ├── accurest
    │   └── bookReturned1.groovy
    └── mappings
----
====

Now consider the following contract:

====
[source,groovy]
----
include::{tests_path}/samples-messaging-camel/src/test/groovy/com/example/CamelMessagingApplicationSpec.groovy[tags=sample_dsl,indent=0]
----
====

To trigger a message from the `return_book_1` label, we use the `StubTrigger` interface, as follows:

====
[source,groovy]
----
stubFinder.trigger("return_book_1")
----
====

That will send out a message to the destination described in the output message of the contract.

Now consider the following Spring Integration Route:

====
[source,xml]
----
include::{tests_path}/spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner-integration/src/test/resources/integration-context.xml[lines=1;18..-1]
----
====

To trigger a message from the `return_book_1` label, use the `StubTrigger` interface, as
follows:

====
[source,groovy]
----
include::{tests_path}/spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner-integration/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/messaging/integration/IntegrationStubRunnerSpec.groovy[tags=client_trigger,indent=0]
----
====

That will send out a message to the destination described in the output message of the contract.

[[features-messaging-stub-runner-stream]]
=== Consumer Side Messaging With Spring Cloud Stream

Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner's messaging module gives you an easy way to
integrate with Spring Stream. For the provided artifacts, it automatically downloads the
stubs and registers the required routes.

CAUTION: If Stub Runner's integration with the Stream `messageFrom` or `sentTo` strings
are resolved first as the `destination` of a channel and no such `destination` exists, the
destination is resolved as a channel name.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
If you want to use Spring Cloud Stream, remember to add a dependency on
`org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-stream` test support, as follows:
