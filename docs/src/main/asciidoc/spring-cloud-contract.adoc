== Spring Cloud Contract

You need confidence when pushing new features to a new application or service in a
distributed system. This project provides support for Consumer Driven Contracts and
service schemas in Spring applications (for both HTTP and message-based interactions),
covering a range of options for writing tests,  publishing them as assets, and asserting
that a contract is kept by producers and consumers.
