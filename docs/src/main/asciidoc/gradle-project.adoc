[[gradle-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

To use Spring Cloud Contract Verifier with WireMock, you must use either a
Gradle or a Maven plugin.

WARNING: If you want to use Spock in your projects, you must separately add the
`spock-core` and `spock-spring` modules. See https://spockframework.github.io/[Spock's
documentation] for more information.

[[gradle-add-gradle-plugin]]
== Add Gradle Plugin with Dependencies

To add a Gradle plugin with dependencies, you can use code similar to the following:

====
[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Plugin DSL GA versions
----
// build.gradle
plugins {
  id "groovy"
  // this will work only for GA versions of Spring Cloud Contract
  id "org.springframework.cloud.contract" version "${GAVerifierVersion}"
}

dependencyManagement {
	imports {
		mavenBom "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-contract-dependencies:${GAVerifierVersion}"
	}
}

dependencies {
	testImplementation "org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:${groovyVersion}"
	// example with adding Spock core and Spock Spring
	testImplementation "org.spockframework:spock-core:${spockVersion}"
	testImplementation "org.spockframework:spock-spring:${spockVersion}"
	testImplementation 'org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier'
}
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Plugin DSL non GA versions
----
// settings.gradle
pluginManagement {
	plugins {
		id "org.springframework.cloud.contract" version "${verifierVersion}"
	}
    repositories {
        // to pick from local .m2
        mavenLocal()
        // for snapshots
        maven { url "https://repo.spring.io/snapshot" }
        // for milestones
        maven { url "https://repo.spring.io/milestone" }
        // for GA versions
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}

// build.gradle
plugins {
  id "groovy"
  id "org.springframework.cloud.contract"
}

dependencyManagement {
	imports {
		mavenBom "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-contract-dependencies:${verifierVersion}"
	}
}

dependencies {
	testImplementation "org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:${groovyVersion}"
	// example with adding Spock core and Spock Spring
	testImplementation "org.spockframework:spock-core:${spockVersion}"
	testImplementation "org.spockframework:spock-spring:${spockVersion}"
	testImplementation 'org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier'
}
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Legacy Plugin Application
----
// build.gradle
buildscript {
	repositories {
		mavenCentral()
	}
	dependencies {
		classpath "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:${springboot_version}"
		classpath "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin:${verifier_version}"
        // here you can also pass additional dependencies such as Pact or Kotlin spec e.g.:
        // classpath "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-contract-spec-kotlin:${verifier_version}"
	}
}

apply plugin: 'groovy'
apply plugin: 'org.springframework.cloud.contract'

dependencyManagement {
	imports {
		mavenBom "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-contract-dependencies:${verifier_version}"
	}
}

dependencies {
	testImplementation "org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:${groovyVersion}"
	// example with adding Spock core and Spock Spring
	testImplementation "org.spockframework:spock-core:${spockVersion}"
	testImplementation "org.spockframework:spock-spring:${spockVersion}"
	testImplementation 'org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier'
}
----
====

[[gradle-and-rest-assured]]
== Gradle and Rest Assured 2.0

By default, Rest Assured 3.x is added to the classpath. However, to use Rest Assured 2.x,
you can add it to the plugins classpath, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
buildscript {
	repositories {
		mavenCentral()
	}
	dependencies {
		classpath "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:${springboot_version}"
		classpath "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin:${verifier_version}"
		classpath "com.jayway.restassured:rest-assured:2.5.0"
		classpath "com.jayway.restassured:spring-mock-mvc:2.5.0"
	}
}

depenendencies {
    // all dependencies
    // you can exclude rest-assured from spring-cloud-contract-verifier
    testCompile "com.jayway.restassured:rest-assured:2.5.0"
    testCompile "com.jayway.restassured:spring-mock-mvc:2.5.0"
}
----
====

That way, the plugin automatically sees that Rest Assured 2.x is present on the classpath
and modifies the imports accordingly.

[[gradle-snapshot-versions]]
== Snapshot Versions for Gradle

You can add the additional snapshot repository to your `build.gradle` to use snapshot versions,
which are automatically uploaded after every successful build, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{standalone_samples_path}/http-server/build.gradle[tags=repos,indent=0]
}
----
====

[[gradle-add-stubs]]
== Add stubs

By default, Spring Cloud Contract Verifier looks for stubs in the
`src/contractTest/resources/contracts` directory. For transitional purposes the plugin
will also look for contracts in `src/test/resources/contracts`, however, this directory
is deprecated as of Spring Cloud Contract 3.0.0.

It should also be noted, that with this new Gradle source set, you should also migrate
any base classes used within your contract tests to `src/contractTest/{language}` where
`{language}` should be replaced with Java or Groovy as needed for your purposes.

The directory that contains stub definitions is treated as a class name, and each stub
definition is treated as a single test. Spring Cloud Contract Verifier assumes that it
contains at least one level of directories that are to be used as the test class name.
If more than one level of nested directories is present, all except the last one is used
as the package name. Consider the following structure:

====
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
src/contractTest/resources/contracts/myservice/shouldCreateUser.groovy
src/contractTest/resources/contracts/myservice/shouldReturnUser.groovy
----
====

Given the preceding structure, Spring Cloud Contract Verifier creates a test class named
`defaultBasePackage.MyService` with two methods:

- `shouldCreateUser()`
- `shouldReturnUser()`

[[gradle-run-plugin]]
== Running the Plugin

The plugin registers itself to be invoked before a `check` task. If you want it to be
part of your build process, you need do nothing more. If you want only to generate
tests, invoke the `generateContractTests` task.

[[gradle-default-setup]]
== Default Setup

The default Gradle Plugin setup creates the following Gradle part of the build (in
pseudocode):

====
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
contracts {
    testFramework ='JUNIT'
    testMode = 'MockMvc'
    generatedTestJavaSourcesDir = project.file("${project.buildDir}/generated-test-sources/contractTest/java")
    generatedTestGroovySourcesDir = project.file("${project.buildDir}/generated-test-sources/contractTest/groovy")
    generatedTestResourcesDir = project.file("${project.buildDir}/generated-test-resources/contracts")
    contractsDslDir = project.file("${project.projectDir}/src/contractTest/resources/contracts")
    basePackageForTests = 'org.springframework.cloud.verifier.tests'
    stubsOutputDir = project.file("${project.buildDir}/stubs")
    sourceSet = null
}

def verifierStubsJar = tasks.register(type: Jar, name: 'verifierStubsJar', dependsOn: 'generateClientStubs') {
    baseName = project.name
    classifier = contracts.stubsSuffix
    from contractVerifier.stubsOutputDir
}

def copyContracts = tasks.register(type: Copy, name: 'copyContracts') {
    from contracts.contractsDslDir
    into contracts.stubsOutputDir
}

verifierStubsJar.dependsOn copyContracts
----
====

[[gradle-configure-plugin]]
== Configuring the Plugin

To change the default configuration, you can add a `contracts` snippet to your Gradle
configuration, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
contracts {
	testMode = 'MockMvc'
	baseClassForTests = 'org.mycompany.tests'
	generatedTestJavaSourcesDir = project.file('src/generatedContract')
}
----
====

To download contracts from a remote source, you can use the following snippets as needed:

====
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
contracts {
    // If your contracts exist in a JAR archive published to a Maven repository
    contractDependency {
        stringNotation = ''
        // OR
        groupId = ''
        artifactId = ''
        version = ''
        classifier = ''
    }

    // If your contracts exist in a Git SCM repository
    contractRepository {
        repositoryUrl = ''
        // username = ''
        // password = ''
    }

    // controls the nested location to find the contracts in either the JAR or Git SCM source
    contractsPath = ''
}
----
====

Since we are using Gradle's Jar packaging task, there are several options and capabilities that you may wish to utilize to further extend what is created by the `verifierStubsJar`. In order to do this, you would use the native mechanisms provided directly by Gradle for customizing an existing task like so:

NOTE: for the sake of the example, we desire to add a `git.properties` file to the `verifierStubsJar`.

====
[source,groovy,inden=0]
----
verifierStubsJar {
    from("${buildDir}/resources/main/") {
        include("git.properties")
    }
}
----
====

It should also be noted that as of 3.0.0, the default publication has been disabled. As a result this means, that you are able to create any named jar and publish it as you would normally have done via Gradle configuration options. This means that you can build a jar file customized just the way you would like and publish that for absolute full control over the jar's layout and contents.

[[gradle-configuration-options]]
== Configuration Options

* `testMode`: Defines the mode for acceptance tests. By default, the mode is MockMvc,
which is based on Spring's MockMvc. It can also be changed to WebTestClient, JaxRsClient, or
Explicit (for real HTTP calls).
* `imports`: Creates an array with imports that should be included in the generated tests
(for example, `['org.myorg.Matchers']`). By default, it creates an empty array.
* `staticImports`: Creates an array with static imports that should be included in
generated tests(for example, `['org.myorg.Matchers.*']`). By default, it creates an empty
array.
* `basePackageForTests`: Specifies the base package for all generated tests. If not set,
the value is picked from the package of `baseClassForTests` and from `packageWithBaseClasses`.
If neither of these values are set, the value is set to
`org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.tests`.
* `baseClassForTests`: Creates a base class for all generated tests. By default, if you
use Spock classes, the class is `spock.lang.Specification`.
* `packageWithBaseClasses`: Defines a package where all the base classes reside. This
setting takes precedence over `baseClassForTests`.
* `baseClassMappings`: Explicitly maps a contract package to a FQN of a base class. This
setting takes precedence over `packageWithBaseClasses` and `baseClassForTests`.
* `ignoredFiles`: Uses an `Antmatcher` to allow defining stub files for which processing
should be skipped. By default, it is an empty array.
* `contractsDslDir`: Specifies the directory that contains contracts written by using the
GroovyDSL. By default, its value is `$projectDir/src/contractTest/resources/contracts`.
* `generatedTestSourcesDir`: Specifies the test source directory where tests generated
from the Groovy DSL should be placed. (Deprecrated)
* `generatedTestJavaSourcesDir`: Specifies the test source directory where Java/JUnit tests generated from the Groovy DSL should be placed. By default, it's value is `$buildDir/generated-tes-sources/contractTest/java`.
* `generatedTestGroovySourcesDir`: Specifies the test source directory where Groovy/Spock tests generated from the Groovy DSL should be placed. By default, it's value is `$buildDir/generated-test-sources/contractTest/groovy`.
* `generatedTestResourcesDir`: Specifies the test resource directory where resources used by the tests generated
from the Groovy DSL should be placed. By default, its value is
`$buildDir/generated-test-resources/contractTest`.
* `stubsOutputDir`: Specifies the directory where the generated WireMock stubs from
the Groovy DSL should be placed.
* `testFramework`: Specifies the target test framework to be used. Currently, Spock, JUnit 4 (`TestFramework.JUNIT`) and
JUnit 5 are supported, with JUnit 4 being the default framework.
* `contractsProperties`: A map that contains properties to be passed to Spring Cloud Contract
components. Those properties might be used by (for example) built-in or custom Stub Downloaders.
* `sourceSet`: Source set where the contracts are stored. If not provided will assume `contractTest` (for example, `project.sourceSets.contractTest.java` for JUnit or `project.sourceSets.contractTest.groovy` for Spock).

You can use the following properties when you want to specify the location of the JAR
that contains the contracts:

* `contractDependency`: Specifies the Dependency that provides
`groupid:artifactid:version:classifier` coordinates. You can use the `contractDependency`
closure to set it up.
* `contractsPath`: Specifies the path to the jar. If contract dependencies are
 downloaded, the path defaults to `groupid/artifactid`, where `groupid` is slash
 separated. Otherwise, it scans contracts under the provided directory.
* `contractsMode`: Specifies the mode for downloading contracts (whether the
JAR is available offline, remotely, and so on).
* `deleteStubsAfterTest`: If set to `false`, does not remove any downloaded
contracts from temporary directories.
* `failOnNoContracts`: When enabled, will throw an exception when no contracts were found. Defaults to `true`.
* `failOnInProgress`: If set to `true`, then, if any contracts that are in progress are found, they break the build. On the producer side, you need to be explicit about the fact that you have contracts in progress and take into consideration that you might be causing false positive test results on the consumer side. Defaults to `true`.

There is also the `contractRepository { ... }` closure that contains the following properties

* `repositoryUrl`: The URL to the repository with contract definitions
* `username` : The repository username
* `password` : The repository password
* `proxyPort` : The port of the proxy
* `proxyHost` : The host of the proxy
* `cacheDownloadedContracts` : If set to `true`, caches the folder where non-snapshot contract artifacts got downloaded. Defaults to `true`.

You can also turn on the following experimental features in the plugin:

* `convertToYaml`: Converts all DSLs to the declarative YAML format. This can be extremely
useful when you use external libraries in your Groovy DSLs. By turning this feature on
(by setting it to `true`), you need not add the library dependency on the consumer side.
* `assertJsonSize`: You can check the size of JSON arrays in the generated tests. This
feature is disabled by default.

[[gradle-single-base-class]]
== Single Base Class for All Tests

When using Spring Cloud Contract Verifier in MockMvc (the default), you need to create a base
specification for all generated acceptance tests. In this class, you need to point to an
endpoint, which should be verified. The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{plugins_path}/spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin/src/test/resources/functionalTest/bootSimple/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/twitter/places/BaseMockMvcSpec.groovy[tags=base_class,indent=0]
----
====

If you use `Explicit` mode, you can use a base class to initialize the whole tested application,
as you might see in regular integration tests. If you use the `JAXRSCLIENT` mode, this
base class should also contain a `protected WebTarget webTarget` field. Right now, the
only option to test the JAX-RS API is to start a web server.

[[gradle-different-base-classes]]
== Different Base Classes for Contracts

If your base classes differ between contracts, you can tell the Spring Cloud Contract
plugin which class should get extended by the autogenerated tests. You have two options:

* Follow a convention by providing the `packageWithBaseClasses`
* Provide explicit mapping by using `baseClassMappings`

=== By Convention

The convention is such that, if you have a contract in (for example)
`src/contractTest/resources/contract/foo/bar/baz/` and set the value of the
`packageWithBaseClasses` property to `com.example.base`, then Spring Cloud Contract
Verifier assumes that there is a `BarBazBase` class under the `com.example.base` package.
In other words, the system takes the last two parts of the package, if they exist, and
forms a class with a `Base` suffix. This rule takes precedence over `baseClassForTests`.
The following example shows how it works in the `contracts` closure:

====
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{plugins_path}/spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/plugin/ContractVerifierSpec.groovy[tags=package_with_base_classes,indent=0]
----
====

=== By Mapping

You can manually map a regular expression of the contract's package to the fully qualified
name of the base class for the matched contract. You have to provide a list called
`baseClassMappings` that consists of `baseClassMapping` objects that take a
`contractPackageRegex` to `baseClassFQN` mapping. Consider the following example:

====
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{plugins_path}/spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/plugin/ContractVerifierSpec.groovy[tags=base_class_mappings,indent=0]
----
====

Assume that you have contracts in the following directories:

- `src/contractTest/resources/contract/com/`
- `src/contractTest/resources/contract/foo/`

By providing `baseClassForTests`, we have a fallback in case mapping did not succeed.
(You could also provide the `packageWithBaseClasses` as a fallback.) That way, the tests
generated from `src/contractTest/resources/contract/com/` contracts extend the
`com.example.ComBase`, whereas the rest of the tests extend `com.example.FooBase`.

[[gradle-invoking-generated-tests]]
== Invoking Generated Tests

To ensure that the provider side is compliant with your defined contracts, you need to run
the following command:

====
[source,bash,indent=0]
----
./gradlew contractTest
----
====

[[gradle-publishing-stubs-to-artifact-repo]]
== Publishing Stubs to Artifact Repository

If you use an binary artifact repository to keep the stubs,
you will need to configure the publishing section for Gradle to
include the `verifierStubsJar`. To do that, you can use the
example configuration below:

====
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
apply plugin: 'maven-publish'

publishing {
    publications {
        maven(MavenPublication) {
            // other configuration

            artifact verifierStubsJar
        }
    }
}
----
====

Since 3.0.0, the internal stubs publication has been deprecated
and disabled by default. It is recommended to include the
`verifierStubsJar` with one of your own publications.

[[gradle-pushing-stubs-to-scm]]
== Pushing Stubs to SCM

If you use the SCM repository to keep the contracts and
stubs, you might want to automate the step of pushing stubs to
the repository. To do that, you can call the `pushStubsToScm`
task by running the following command:

====
[source,bash,indent=0]
----
$ ./gradlew pushStubsToScm
----
====

Under <<scm-stub-downloader>>, you can find all possible
configuration options that you can pass either through
the `contractsProperties` field (for example, `contracts { contractsProperties = [foo:"bar"] }`),
through the `contractsProperties` method (for example, `contracts { contractsProperties([foo:"bar"]) }`),
or through a system property or an environment variable.

[[gradle-consumer]]
== Spring Cloud Contract Verifier on the Consumer Side

In a consuming service, you need to configure the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier plugin
in exactly the same way as in the case of a provider. If you do not want to use Stub Runner,
you need to copy the contracts stored in `src/contractTest/resources/contracts` and generate
WireMock JSON stubs by using the following command:

====
[source,bash,indent=0]
----
./gradlew generateClientStubs
----
====

NOTE: The `stubsOutputDir` option has to be set for stub generation to work.

When present, you can use JSON stubs in automated tests to consume a service. The
following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
@ContextConfiguration(loader == SpringApplicationContextLoader, classes == Application)
class LoanApplicationServiceSpec extends Specification {

 @ClassRule
 @Shared
 WireMockClassRule wireMockRule == new WireMockClassRule()

 @Autowired
 LoanApplicationService sut

 def 'should successfully apply for loan'() {
   given:
 	LoanApplication application =
			new LoanApplication(client: new Client(clientPesel: '12345678901'), amount: 123.123)
   when:
	LoanApplicationResult loanApplication == sut.loanApplication(application)
   then:
	loanApplication.loanApplicationStatus == LoanApplicationStatus.LOAN_APPLIED
	loanApplication.rejectionReason == null
 }
}
----
====

In the preceding example, `LoanApplication` makes a call to the `FraudDetection` service.
This request is handled by a WireMock server configured with stubs that were generated by
Spring Cloud Contract Verifier.
