== Stub Runner for Messaging

Stub Runner can run the published stubs in memory. It can integrate with the following
frameworks:

* Spring Integration
* Spring Cloud Stream
* Apache Camel
* Spring AMQP

It also provides entry points to integrate with any other solution on the market.

=== Stub triggering

To trigger a message, use the `StubTrigger` interface:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{stubrunner_core_path}/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/StubTrigger.java[lines=16..-1]
----

For convenience, the `StubFinder` interface extends `StubTrigger`, so you only need one
or the other in your tests.

`StubTrigger` gives you the following options to trigger a message:

* <<trigger-label>>
* <<trigger-group-artifact-ids>>
* <<trigger-artifact-ids>>
* <<trigger-all-messages>>

[[trigger-label]]
==== Trigger by Label
