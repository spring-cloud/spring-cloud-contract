Modules giving you the possibility to use
http://wiremock.org[WireMock] with different servers by using the
"ambient" server embedded in a Spring Boot application. Check out the
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/master/samples[samples]
for more details.

If you have a Spring Boot application that uses Tomcat as an embedded
server, for example (the default with `spring-boot-starter-web`), then
you can simply add `spring-cloud-contract-wiremock` to your classpath
and add `@AutoConfigureWireMock` in order to be able to use Wiremock
in your tests. Wiremock runs as a stub server and you can register
stub behaviour using a Java API or via static JSON declarations as
part of your test. Here's a simple example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{doc_samples}/src/test/java/com/example/WiremockForDocsTests.java[tags=wiremock_test1]
include::{doc_samples}/src/test/java/com/example/WiremockForDocsTests.java[tags=wiremock_test2]
----

To start the stub server on a different port use `@AutoConfigureWireMock(port=9999)` (for example), and for a random port use the value 0. The stub server port will be bindable in the test application context as "wiremock.server.port". Using `@AutoConfigureWireMock` adds a bean of type `WiremockConfiguration` to your test application context, where it will be cached in between methods and classes having the same context, just like for normal Spring integration tests.

For a more conventional WireMock experience, using JUnit `@Rules` to
start and stop the server, just use the `WireMockSpring` convenience
class to obtain an `Options` instance:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{doc_samples}/src/test/java/com/example/WiremockForDocsClassRuleTests.java[tags=wiremock_test1]
include::{doc_samples}/src/test/java/com/example/WiremockForDocsClassRuleTests.java[tags=wiremock_test2]
----

The use `@ClassRule` means that the server will shut down after all the methods in this class.

== WireMock and Spring MVC Mocks

Spring Cloud Contract provides a convenience class that can load JSON WireMock stubs into a
Spring `MockRestServiceServer`. Here's an example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{doc_samples}/src/test/java/com/example/WiremockForDocsMockServerApplicationTests.java[tags=wiremock_test]
----

The `baseUrl` is prepended to all mock calls, and the `expect()`
method takes a stub name as an argument, where the stubs are stored in
the classpath at `/stubs/<name>.json` by default. So in this example
the stub defined at `/stubs/resource.json` is loaded into the mock
server, so if the `RestTemplate` is asked to visit
`http://example.org/` it will get the responses as declared there. The
JSON format is the normal WireMock format which you can read about in
the WireMock website.

Currently we support Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow as Spring Boot
embedded servers, and Wiremock itself has "native" support for a
particular version of Jetty (currently 9.2). To use the native Jetty
you need to add the native wiremock dependencies and exclude the
Spring Boot container if there is one.
