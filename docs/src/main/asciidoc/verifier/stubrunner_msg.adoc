=== Stub Runner for Messaging

Stub Runner has the functionality to run the published stubs in memory. It can integrate with the following frameworks out of the box

- Spring Integration
- Spring Cloud Stream
- Apache Camel
- Spring AMQP

It also provides points of entry to integrate with any other solution on the market.

==== Stub triggering

To trigger a message it's enough to use the `StubTrigger` interface:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{stubrunner_core_path}/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/StubTrigger.java[lines=16..-1]
----

For convenience the `StubFinder` interface extends `StubTrigger` so it's enough to use only one in your tests.

`StubTrigger` gives you the following options to trigger a message:

===== Trigger by label

[source,groovy]
----
