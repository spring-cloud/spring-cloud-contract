== How to build it

IMPORTANT: You need to have all the necessary Groovy plugins
 installed for your IDE to properly resolve the sources. For example in
 Intellij IDEA having both Eclipse Groovy Compiler Plugin & GMavenPlus Intellij Plugin
 results in properly imported project.

IMPORTANT: Spring Cloud Contract builds Docker images. Remember to
have Docker installed.

IMPORTANT: If you want to run the build in offline mode, you have to have Maven 3.5.2+ installed.

=== Project structure

Here you can find the Spring Cloud Contract folder structure

```
├── config
├── docker
├── samples
├── scripts
├── specs
├── spring-cloud-contract-dependencies
├── spring-cloud-contract-shade
├── spring-cloud-contract-starters
├── spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner
├── spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner-boot
├── spring-cloud-contract-tools
├── spring-cloud-contract-verifier
├── spring-cloud-contract-wiremock
└── tests
```

 - `config` - folder contains setup for Spring Cloud Release Tools automated release process
 - `docker` - folder contains docker images
 - `samples` - folder contains test samples together with standalone ones used also to build documentation
 - `scripts` - contains scripts to build and test `Spring Cloud Contract` with Maven, Gradle and standalone projects
 - `specs` - contains specifications for the Contract DSL.
 - `spring-cloud-contract-dependencies` - contains Spring Cloud Contract BOM
 - `spring-cloud-contract-shade` - shaded dependencies used by the plugins
 - `spring-cloud-contract-starters` - contains Spring Cloud Contract Starters
 - `spring-cloud-contract-spec` - contains specification modules (contains concept of a Contract)
 - `spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner` - contains Stub Runner related modules
 - `spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner-boot` - contains Stub Runner Boot app
 - `spring-cloud-contract-tools` - Gradle and Maven plugin for `Spring Cloud Contract Verifier`
 - `spring-cloud-contract-verifier` - core of the `Spring Cloud Contract Verifier` functionality
 - `spring-cloud-contract-wiremock` - all WireMock related functionality
 - `tests` - integration tests for different messaging technologies

=== Commands

To build the core functionality together with Maven Plugin you can run

```
./mvnw clean install -P integration
```

Calling that function will build core, Maven plugin, Gradle plugin and run end to end tests on the
standalone samples in proper order (both for Maven and Gradle).

To build the Gradle Plugin only

```
cd spring-cloud-contract-tools/spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin
./gradlew clean build
```

=== Helpful scripts

We're providing a couple of helpful scripts to build the project.

To build the project in parallel (by default uses 4 cores but you can change it)

```
./scripts/parallelBuild.sh
```

and with 8 cores

```
CORES=8 ./scripts/parallelBuild.sh
```

To build the project without any integration tests (by default uses 1 core)

```
./scripts/noIntegration.sh
```

and with 8 cores

```
CORES=8 ./scripts/noIntegration.sh
```

To generate the documentation (both the root one and the maven plugin one)

```
./scripts/generateDocs.sh
```
