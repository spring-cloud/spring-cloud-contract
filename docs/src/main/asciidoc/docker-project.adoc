include::_attributes.adoc[]

In this section, we publish a `springcloud/spring-cloud-contract` Docker image
that contains a project that generates tests and runs them in `EXPLICIT` mode
against a running application.

TIP: The `EXPLICIT` mode means that the tests generated from contracts send
real requests and not mocked ones.

We also publish a `spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner` Docker image
that starts the standalone version of Stub Runner.

[[docker-intro]]
== A Short Introduction to Maven, JARs, and Binary Storage

Since non-JVM projects can use the Docker image, it is good to
explain the basic terms behind Spring Cloud Contract packaging defaults.

Parts of the following definitions were taken from the https://maven.apache.org/glossary.html[Maven Glossary]:

- `Project`: Maven thinks in terms of projects. Projects
are all you build. Those projects follow a well defined
"`Project Object Model`". Projects can depend on other projects --
in that case, the latter are called "`dependencies`". A project may
consistent of several subprojects. However, these subprojects are still
treated equally as projects.
- `Artifact`: An artifact is something that is either produced or used
by a project. Examples of artifacts produced by Maven for a project
include JAR files and source and binary distributions. Each artifact
is uniquely identified by a group ID and an artifact ID that is
unique within a group.
- `JAR`: JAR stands for Java ARchive. Its format is based on
the ZIP file format. Spring Cloud Contract packages the contracts and generated
stubs in a JAR file.
- `GroupId`: A group ID is a universally unique identifier for a project.
While this is often just the project name (for example, `commons-collections`),
it is helpful to use a fully-qualified package name to distinguish it
from other projects with a similar name (for example, `org.apache.maven`).
Typically, when published to the Artifact Manager, the `GroupId` gets
slash separated and forms part of the URL. For example, for a group ID of `com.example`
and an artifact ID of `application`, the result would be `/com/example/application/`.
- `Classifier`: The Maven dependency notation looks as follows:
`groupId:artifactId:version:classifier`. The classifier is an additional suffix
passed to the dependency -- for example, `stubs` or `sources`. The same dependency
(for example, `com.example:application`) can produce multiple artifacts that
differ from each other with the classifier.
- `Artifact manager`: When you generate binaries, sources, or packages, you would
like them to be available for others to download, reference, or reuse. In the case
of the JVM world, those artifacts are generally JARs. For Ruby, those artifacts are gems.
For Docker, those artifacts are Docker images. You can store those artifacts
in a manager. Examples of such managers include https://jfrog.com/artifactory/[Artifactory]
and https://www.sonatype.org/nexus/[Nexus].

[[docker-how-it-works]]
== Generating Tests on the Producer Side

The image searches for contracts under the `/contracts` folder.
The output from running the tests is available in the
`/spring-cloud-contract/build` folder (useful for debugging
purposes).

You can mount your contracts and pass the environment variables.
The image then:

- Generates the contract tests
- Runs the tests against the provided URL
- Generates the https://github.com/tomakehurst/wiremock[WireMock] stubs
- Publishes the stubs to a Artifact Manager (optional -- turned on by default)

[[docker-env-vars]]
=== Environment Variables

The Docker image requires some environment variables to point to
your running application, to the Artifact manager instance, and so on.
The following list describes the environment variables:

include::{project-root}/docker/spring-cloud-contract-docker/target/adoc/props.adoc[indent=0]

The following environment variables are used when tests are run:

include::{project-root}/docker/spring-cloud-contract-docker/target/adoc/appProps.adoc[indent=0]

### Customizing the gradle build

You can provide a customized `gradle.build` to be run in the container by mounting your customized build file as a volume when running the container:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ docker run -v <absolute-path-of-your-custom-file>:/spring-cloud-contract/build.gradle springcloud/spring-cloud-contract:<version>
----
====

[[docker-example-of-usage]]
=== Example of Usage via HTTP

In this section, we explore a simple MVC application. To get started, clone the following
git repository and cd to the resulting directory, by running the following commands:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/spring-cloud-contract-nodejs
$ cd bookstore
----
====

The contracts are available in the `/contracts` folder.

Since we want to run tests, we can run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ npm test
----
====

However, for learning purposes, we split it into pieces, as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
# Stop docker infra (nodejs, artifactory)
$ ./stop_infra.sh
# Start docker infra (nodejs, artifactory)
$ ./setup_infra.sh

# Kill & Run app
$ pkill -f "node app"
$ nohup node app &

# Prepare environment variables
$ SC_CONTRACT_DOCKER_VERSION="..."
$ APP_IP="192.168.0.100"
$ APP_PORT="3000"
$ ARTIFACTORY_PORT="8081"
$ APPLICATION_BASE_URL="http://${APP_IP}:${APP_PORT}"
$ ARTIFACTORY_URL="http://${APP_IP}:${ARTIFACTORY_PORT}/artifactory/libs-release-local"
$ CURRENT_DIR="$( pwd )"
$ CURRENT_FOLDER_NAME=${PWD##*/}
$ PROJECT_VERSION="0.0.1.RELEASE"

# Run contract tests
$ docker run  --rm -e "APPLICATION_BASE_URL=${APPLICATION_BASE_URL}" -e "PUBLISH_ARTIFACTS=true" -e "PROJECT_NAME=${CURRENT_FOLDER_NAME}" -e "REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL=${ARTIFACTORY_URL}" -e "PROJECT_VERSION=${PROJECT_VERSION}" -v "${CURRENT_DIR}/contracts/:/contracts:ro" -v "${CURRENT_DIR}/node_modules/spring-cloud-contract/output:/spring-cloud-contract-output/" springcloud/spring-cloud-contract:"${SC_CONTRACT_DOCKER_VERSION}"

# Kill app
$ pkill -f "node app"
----
====

Through bash scripts, the following happens:

- The infrastructure (MongoDb and Artifactory) is set up.
In a real-life scenario, you would run the NodeJS application
with a mocked database. In this example, we want to show how we can
benefit from Spring Cloud Contract in very little time.
- Due to those constraints, the contracts also represent the
stateful situation.
** The first request is a `POST` that causes data to get inserted into the database.
** The second request is a `GET` that returns a list of data with 1 previously inserted element.
- The NodeJS application is started (on port `3000`).
- The contract tests are generated through Docker, and tests
are run against the running application.
** The contracts are taken from `/contracts` folder.
** The output of the test is available under
`node_modules/spring-cloud-contract/output`.
- The stubs are uploaded to Artifactory. You can find them in
http://localhost:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/example/bookstore/0.0.1.RELEASE/.
The stubs are at http://localhost:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/example/bookstore/0.0.1.RELEASE/bookstore-0.0.1.RELEASE-stubs.jar.

[[docker-example-of-usage-messaging]]
=== Example of Usage via Messaging

If you want to use Spring Cloud Contract with messaging via the Docker images (e.g.
in case of polyglot applications) then you'll have to have the following prerequisites met:

* Middleware (e.g. RabbitMQ or Kafka) must be running before generating tests
* Your contract needs to call a method `triggerMessage(...)` with a `String` parameter that is equal to the contract's `label`.
* Your application needs to have a HTTP endpoint via which we can trigger a message
** That endpoint should not be available on production (could be enabled via an environment variable)

[[docker-example-of-usage-messaging-contract]]
==== Example of a Messaging Contract

The contract needs to call a `triggerMessage(...)` method. That method is already provided in the base class for all tests in the docker image and will send out a request to the HTTP endpoint on the producer side. Below you can find examples of such contracts.

----
====

[[docker-example-of-usage-messaging-endpoint]]
==== HTTP Endpoint to Trigger a Message

Why is there need to develop such an endpoint? Spring Cloud Contract
would have to generate code in various languages (as it does in Java) to make it possible to trigger production
code that sends a message to a broker. If such code is not generated then we need to be able to trigger the message anyways, and the way to do it is to provide an HTTP endpoint that the user will prepare in the language of their choosing.

The endpoint must have the following configuration:

- URL: `/springcloudcontract/{label}` where `label` can be any text
- Method: `POST`
- Basing on the `label` will generate a message that will be sent to a given destination according to the contract definition

Below you have an example of such an endpoint. If you're interested in
providing an example in your language don't hesitate to file an issue in
the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=New+Polyglot+Sample+of+a+HTTP+controller[Spring Cloud Contract repository at Github].

==== Running Message Tests on the Producer Side

Now, let's generate tests from contracts to test the producer side.
We will run bash code to start the Docker image
with attached contracts, however we will also add variables for the messaging
code to work. In this case let's assume that the contracts are being stored in
a Git repository.

====

kill $APP_PID

====

What will happen is:

- Tests will be generated from contracts taken from Git
- In the contract we've provided an entry in metadata called `declareQueueWithName` that will lead to creation of a queue in RabbitMQ with the given name *before* the request to trigger the message is sent
- Via the `triggerMessage("ping_pong")` method call a POST request to the Python application to the `/springcloudcontract/ping_pong` endpoint will be made
- The Python application will generate and send a `'{"message":"pong"}'` JSON via RabbitMQ to an exchange called `output`
- The generated test will poll for a message sent to the `output` exchange
- Once the message was received will assert its contents

After the tests have passed we know that the message was properly sent from the Python app to RabbitMQ.

[[docker-stubrunner]]
== Running Stubs on the Consumer Side

This section describes how to use Docker on the consumer side to fetch and run stubs.

We publish a `spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner` Docker image
that starts the standalone version of Stub Runner.

[[docker-stubrunner-env-vars]]
=== Environment Variables

You can run the docker image and pass any of the <<project-features.adoc#features-stub-runner-common-properties-junit-spring, common properties for JUnit and Spring>>
as environment variables. The convention is that all the
letters should be upper case.
The dot (`.`) should be replaced with underscore (`_`) characters. For example,
the `stubrunner.repositoryRoot` property should be represented
as a `STUBRUNNER_REPOSITORY_ROOT` environment variable.

In addition to those variables you can set the following ones:

- `MESSAGING_TYPE` - what type of messaging system are you using (currently supported are `rabbit`, `kafka`)
- `ADDITIONAL_OPTS` - any additional properties that you would like to pass to the application

[[docker-stubrunner-example]]
=== Example of Usage

We want to use the stubs created in this <<docker-server-side>> step.
Assume that we want to run the stubs on port `9876`. You can see the NodeJS code
by cloning the repository and changing to the directory indicated in the following commands:

====
[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/spring-cloud-contract-nodejs
$ cd bookstore
----
====

Now we can run the Stub Runner Boot application with the stubs, by running the following
commands:

====
[source,bash]
----
# Provide the Spring Cloud Contract Docker version
$ SC_CONTRACT_DOCKER_VERSION="..."
# The IP at which the app is running and Docker container can reach it
$ APP_IP="192.168.0.100"
# Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner properties
$ STUBRUNNER_PORT="8083"
# Stub coordinates 'groupId:artifactId:version:classifier:port'
$ STUBRUNNER_IDS="com.example:bookstore:0.0.1.RELEASE:stubs:9876"
$ STUBRUNNER_REPOSITORY_ROOT="http://${APP_IP}:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local"
# Run the docker with Stub Runner Boot
$ docker run  --rm \
    -e "STUBRUNNER_IDS=${STUBRUNNER_IDS}" \
    -e "STUBRUNNER_REPOSITORY_ROOT=${STUBRUNNER_REPOSITORY_ROOT}" \
    -e "STUBRUNNER_STUBS_MODE=REMOTE" \
    -p "${STUBRUNNER_PORT}:${STUBRUNNER_PORT}" \
    -p "9876:9876" \
    springcloud/spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner:"${SC_CONTRACT_DOCKER_VERSION}"
----
====

When the preceding commands run,

- A standalone Stub Runner application gets started.
- It downloads the stub with coordinates `com.example:bookstore:0.0.1.RELEASE:stubs` on port `9876`.
- It gets downloads from Artifactory running at `http://192.168.0.100:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local`.
- After a while, Stub Runner is running on port `8083`.
- The stubs are running at port `9876`.

On the server side, we built a stateful stub. We can use curl to assert
that the stubs are setup properly. To do so, run the following commands:

====
[source,bash]
----
# let's run the first request (no response is returned)
$ curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -X POST --data '{ "title" : "Title", "genre" : "Genre", "description" : "Description", "author" : "Author", "publisher" : "Publisher", "pages" : 100, "image_url" : "https://d213dhlpdb53mu.cloudfront.net/assets/pivotal-square-logo-41418bd391196c3022f3cd9f3959b3f6d7764c47873d858583384e759c7db435.svg", "buy_url" : "https://pivotal.io" }' http://localhost:9876/api/books
# Now time for the second request
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:9876/api/books
# You will receive contents of the JSON
----
====

IMPORTANT: If you want use the stubs that you have built locally, on your host,
you should set the `-e STUBRUNNER_STUBS_MODE=LOCAL` environment variable and mount
the volume of your local m2 (`-v "${HOME}/.m2/:/home/scc/.m2:ro"`).

[[docker-stubrunner-example-messaging]]
=== Example of Usage with Messaging

In order to make messaging work it's enough to pass the `MESSAGING_TYPE` environment variable with `kafka` or `rabbit` values. This will lead to setting up
the Stub Runner Boot Docker image with dependencies required to connect to the broker.

In order to set the connection properties you can check out Spring Cloud Stream properties page to set proper environment variables.

// TODO: Change to current or sth
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#integration-properties[Spring Boot Integration properties]
** You can search for `spring.rabbitmq.xxx` or `spring.kafka.xxx` properties
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit/docs/3.1.0.M1/reference/html/index.html#_configuration_options[Stream specific RabbitMQ properties]
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka/docs/3.1.0.M1/reference/html/index.html#_configuration_options[Stream specific Kafka properties]

The most common property you would set is the location of the running middlewara.
If a property to set it is called `spring.rabbitmq.addresses` or `spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers` then you should name the environment variable `SPRING_RABBITMQ_ADDRESSES` and `SPRING_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` respectively.

[[docker-middleware-standalone]]
== Running Contract Tests against Existing Middleware

There is legitimate reason to run your contract tests against existing middleware. Some
testing frameworks might give you false positive results - the test within your build
passes whereas on production the communication fails.

In Spring Cloud Contract docker images we give an option to connect to existing middleware.
As presented in previous subsections we do support Kafka and RabbitMQ out of the box. However,
via https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/index.html[Apache Camel Components] we can support
other middleware too. Let's take a look at the following examples of usage.

[[docker-verifier-running-middlware]]
=== Spring Cloud Contract Docker and running Middleware

In order to connect to arbitrary middleware, we'll leverage the `standalone` metadata entry
in the contract section.

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
description: 'Send a pong message in response to a ping message'
label: 'standalone_ping_pong' <1>
input:
  triggeredBy: 'triggerMessage("ping_pong")' <2>
outputMessage:
  sentTo: 'rabbitmq:output' <3>
  body: <4>
    message: 'pong'
metadata:
  standalone: <5>
    setup: <6>
      options: rabbitmq:output?queue=output&routingKey=# <7>
    outputMessage: <8>
      additionalOptions: routingKey=#&queue=output <9>
----
<1> Label by which we'll be able to trigger the message via Stub Runner
<2> As in the previous messaging examples we'll need to trigger the HTTP endpoint in the running application to make it send a message according to the provided protocol
<3> `protocol:destination` as requested by Apache Camel
<4> Output message body
<5> Standalone metadata entry
<6> Setup part will contain information about how to prepare for running contract tests before the actual call to HTTP endpoint of the running application is made
<7> Apache Camel URI to be called in the setup phase. In this case we will try to poll for a message at the `output` exchange and due to to having the `queue=output` and `routingKey=#` a queue with name `output` will be set and bound to the `output` exchange with routing key `#`
<8> Additional options (more technical ones) to be appended to the `protocol:destination` from point (3) - together will be combined in the following format `rabbitmq:output?routingKey=#&queue=output`.

For the contract tests to pass we will need as usual in case of messaging in polyglot environment
a running application and running middleware. This time we will have different environment variables set for the Spring Cloud Contract Docker image.

```
<1> We're injecting the address of RabbitMQ via https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/rabbitmq-component.html#_spring_boot_auto_configuration[Apache Camel's Spring Boot Auto-Configuration]
<2> We're telling Stub Runner which stubs to download
<3> We're providing an external location for our stubs (Git repository)
<4> Via the `ADDITIONAL_OPTS=--thin.properties.dependencies.XXX=GROUP:ARTIFACT:VERSION` property we're telling Stub Runner which additional dependency to fetch at runtime. In this case we want to fetch `camel-rabbitmq-starter` so `XXX` is a random string and we want to fetch `org.apache.camel.springboot:camel-rabbitmq-starter` artifact in version `3.4.0`.
<5> Since we're using Git, the remote option of fetching stubs needs to be set
<6> So that we speed up launching of Stub Runner, we're attaching our local Maven repository `.m2` as a volume. If you don't have it populated you can consider setting the write permissions via `:rw` instead read only `:ro`.
<7> We expose the port `8750` at which Stub Runner is running.
<8> Coordinates of the Stub Runner Docker image.

After a while you'll notice the following text in your console, which means that Stub Runner is ready to accept requests.
