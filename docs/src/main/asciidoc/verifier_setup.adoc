== Spring Cloud Contract Verifier Setup

You can set up Spring Cloud Contract Verifier in the following ways:

* <<gradle-project,As a Gradle project>>
* <<maven-project,As a Maven project>>
* <<docker-project,As a Docker project>>

[[gradle-project]]
=== Gradle Project

To learn how to set up the Gradle project for Spring Cloud Contract Verifier, read the
following sections:

* <<gradle-prerequisites>>
* <<gradle-add-gradle-plugin>>
* <<gradle-and-rest-assured>>
* <<gradle-snapshot-versions>>
* <<gradle-add-stubs>>
* <<gradle-default-setup>>
* <<gradle-configure-plugin>>
* <<gradle-configuration-options>>
* <<gradle-single-base-class>>
* <<gradle-different-base-classes>>
* <<gradle-invoking-generated-tests>>
* <<gradle-pushing-stubs-to-scm>>
* <<gradle-consumer>>

[[gradle-prerequisites]]
==== Prerequisites

In order to use Spring Cloud Contract Verifier with WireMock, you muse use either a
Gradle or a Maven plugin.

WARNING: If you want to use Spock in your projects, you must add separately the
`spock-core` and `spock-spring` modules. Check http://spockframework.github.io/[Spock
docs for more information]

[[gradle-add-gradle-plugin]]
==== Add Gradle Plugin with Dependencies

To add a Gradle plugin with dependencies, use code similar to this:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
buildscript {
	repositories {
		mavenCentral()
	}
	dependencies {
	    classpath "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:${springboot_version}"
		classpath "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin:${verifier_version}"
	}
}

apply plugin: 'groovy'
apply plugin: 'spring-cloud-contract'

dependencyManagement {
	imports {
		mavenBom "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-contract-dependencies:${verifier_version}"
	}
}

dependencies {
	testCompile 'org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:2.4.6'
	// example with adding Spock core and Spock Spring
	testCompile 'org.spockframework:spock-core:1.0-groovy-2.4'
	testCompile 'org.spockframework:spock-spring:1.0-groovy-2.4'
	testCompile 'org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier'
}
----

[[gradle-and-rest-assured]]
==== Gradle and Rest Assured 2.0

By default, Rest Assured 3.x is added to the classpath. However, to use Rest Assured 2.x
you can add it to the plugins classpath, as shown here:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
buildscript {
	repositories {
		mavenCentral()
	}
	dependencies {
	    classpath "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:${springboot_version}"
		classpath "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin:${verifier_version}"
		classpath "com.jayway.restassured:rest-assured:2.5.0"
		classpath "com.jayway.restassured:spring-mock-mvc:2.5.0"
	}
}

depenendencies {
    // all dependencies
    // you can exclude rest-assured from spring-cloud-contract-verifier
    testCompile "com.jayway.restassured:rest-assured:2.5.0"
    testCompile "com.jayway.restassured:spring-mock-mvc:2.5.0"
}
----

That way, the plugin automatically sees that Rest Assured 2.x is present on the classpath
and modifies the imports accordingly.

[[gradle-snapshot-versions]]
==== Snapshot Versions for Gradle

Add the additional snapshot repository to your build.gradle to use snapshot versions,
which are automatically uploaded after every successful build, as shown here:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{standalone_samples_path}/http-server/build.gradle[tags=repos,indent=0]
}
----
[[gradle-add-stubs]]
==== Add stubs

By default, Spring Cloud Contract Verifier is looking for stubs in the
`src/test/resources/contracts` directory.

The directory containing stub definitions is treated as a class name, and each stub
definition is treated as a single test. Spring Cloud Contract Verifier assumes that it
contains at  least one level of directories that are to be used as the test class name.
If more than  one level of nested directories is present, all except the last one is used
as the package name. For example, with following structure:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
src/test/resources/contracts/myservice/shouldCreateUser.groovy
src/test/resources/contracts/myservice/shouldReturnUser.groovy
----

Spring Cloud Contract Verifier creates a test class named `defaultBasePackage.MyService`
with two methods:

 - `shouldCreateUser()`
 - `shouldReturnUser()`

[[gradle-run-plugin]]
==== Run the Plugin

The plugin registers itself to be invoked before a `check` task. If you want it to be
part of your build process, you need to do nothing more. If you just want to generate
tests, invoke the `generateContractTests` task.

[[gradle-default-setup]]
==== Default Setup

The default Gradle Plugin setup creates the following Gradle part of the build (in
pseudocode):

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
contracts {
    targetFramework = 'JUNIT'
    testMode = 'MockMvc'
    generatedTestSourcesDir = project.file("${project.buildDir}/generated-test-sources/contracts")
    contractsDslDir = "${project.rootDir}/src/test/resources/contracts"
    basePackageForTests = 'org.springframework.cloud.verifier.tests'
    stubsOutputDir = project.file("${project.buildDir}/stubs")

    // the following properties are used when you want to provide where the JAR with contract lays
    contractDependency {
        stringNotation = ''
    }
    contractsPath = ''
    contractsWorkOffline = false
    contractRepository {
        cacheDownloadedContracts(true)
    }
}

tasks.create(type: Jar, name: 'verifierStubsJar', dependsOn: 'generateClientStubs') {
    baseName = project.name
    classifier = contracts.stubsSuffix
    from contractVerifier.stubsOutputDir
}

project.artifacts {
    archives task
}

tasks.create(type: Copy, name: 'copyContracts') {
    from contracts.contractsDslDir
    into contracts.stubsOutputDir
}

verifierStubsJar.dependsOn 'copyContracts'

publishing {
    publications {
        stubs(MavenPublication) {
            artifactId project.name
            artifact verifierStubsJar
        }
    }
}
----

[[gradle-configure-plugin]]
==== Configure Plugin

To change the default configuration, add a `contracts` snippet to your Gradle config, as
shown here:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
contracts {
	testMode = 'MockMvc'
	baseClassForTests = 'org.mycompany.tests'
	generatedTestSourcesDir = project.file('src/generatedContract')
}
----

[[gradle-configuration-options]]
==== Configuration Options

* *testMode*: Defines the mode for acceptance tests. By default, the mode is MockMvc,
which is based on Spring's MockMvc. It can also be changed to *JaxRsClient* or to
*Explicit* for real HTTP calls.
* *imports*: Creates an array with imports that should be included in generated tests
(for example ['org.myorg.Matchers']). By default, it creates an empty array.
* *staticImports*: Creates an array with static imports that should be included in
generated tests(for example ['org.myorg.Matchers.*']). By default, it creates an empty
array.
* *basePackageForTests*: Specifies the base package for all generated tests. If not set,
the value is picked from `baseClassForTests`'s package and from `packageWithBaseClasses`.
If neither of these values are set, then the value is set to
`org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.tests`.
* *baseClassForTests*: Creates a base class for all generated tests. By default, if you
use Spock classes, the class is `spock.lang.Specification`.
* *packageWithBaseClasses*: Defines a package where all the base classes reside. This
setting takes precedence over *baseClassForTests*.
* *baseClassMappings*: Explicitly maps a contract package to a FQN of a base class. This
setting takes precedence over *packageWithBaseClasses* and *baseClassForTests*.
* *ruleClassForTests*: Specifies a rule that should be added to the generated test
classes.
* *ignoredFiles*: Uses an `Antmatcher` to allow defining stub files for which processing
should be skipped. By default, it is an empty array.
* *contractsDslDir*: Specifies the directory containing contracts written using the
GroovyDSL. By default, its value is `$rootDir/src/test/resources/contracts`.
* *generatedTestSourcesDir*: Specifies the test source directory where tests generated
from the Groovy DSL should be placed. By default its value is
`$buildDir/generated-test-sources/contractVerifier`.
* *stubsOutputDir*: Specifies the directory where the generated WireMock stubs from
the Groovy DSL should be placed.
* *targetFramework*: Specifies the target test framework to be used. Currently, Spock and
JUnit are supported with JUnit being the default framework.
* *contractsProperties*: a map containing properties to be passed to Spring Cloud Contract
components. Those properties might be used by e.g. inbuilt or custom Stub Downloaders.

The following properties are used when you want to specify the location of the JAR
containing the contracts:
* *contractDependency*: Specifies the Dependency that provides
`groupid:artifactid:version:classifier` coordinates. You can use the `contractDependency`
closure to set it up.
* *contractsPath*: Specifies the path to the jar. If contract dependencies are
 downloaded, the path defaults to `groupid/artifactid` where `groupid` is slash
 separated. Otherwise, it scans contracts under the provided directory.
* *contractsMode*: Specifies the mode of downloading contracts (whether the
JAR is available offline, remotely etc.)
* *contractsSnapshotCheckSkip*: If set to `true` will not assert whether the
downloaded stubs / contract JAR was downloaded from a remote location or a local one(only applicable to Maven repos, not Git or Pact).
* *deleteStubsAfterTest*: If set to `false` will not remove any downloaded
contracts from temporary directories

[[gradle-single-base-class]]
==== Single Base Class for All Tests

When using Spring Cloud Contract Verifier in default MockMvc, you need to create a base
specification for all generated acceptance tests. In this class, you need to point to an
endpoint, which should be verified.

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{plugins_path}/spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin/src/test/resources/functionalTest/bootSimple/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/twitter/places/BaseMockMvcSpec.groovy[tags=base_class,indent=0]
----

If you use `Explicit` mode, you can use a base class to initialize the whole tested app
as you might see in regular integration tests. If you use the `JAXRSCLIENT` mode, this
base class should also contain a `protected WebTarget webTarget` field. Right now, the
only option to test the JAX-RS API is to start a web server.

[[gradle-different-base-classes]]
==== Different Base Classes for Contracts

If your base classes differ between contracts, you can tell the Spring Cloud Contract
plugin which class should get extended by the autogenerated tests. You have two options:

* Follow a convention by providing the `packageWithBaseClasses`
* Provide explicit mapping via `baseClassMappings`

*By Convention*

The convention is such that if you have a contract under (for example)
`src/test/resources/contract/foo/bar/baz/` and set the value of the
`packageWithBaseClasses` property to `com.example.base`, then Spring Cloud Contract
Verifier assumes that there is a `BarBazBase` class under the `com.example.base` package.
In other words, the system takes the last two parts of the package, if they exist, and
forms a class with a `Base` suffix. This rule takes precedence over *baseClassForTests*.
Here is an example of how it works in the `contracts` closure:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{plugins_path}/spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/plugin/ContractVerifierSpec.groovy[tags=package_with_base_classes,indent=0]
----

*By Mapping*

You can manually map a regular expression of the contract's package to fully qualified
name of the base class for the matched contract. You have to provide a list called
`baseClassMappings` that consists `baseClassMapping` objects that takes a
`contractPackageRegex` to `baseClassFQN` mapping. Consider the following example:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{plugins_path}/spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/plugin/ContractVerifierSpec.groovy[tags=base_class_mappings,indent=0]
----

Let's assume that you have contracts under
 - `src/test/resources/contract/com/`
 - `src/test/resources/contract/foo/`

By providing the `baseClassForTests`, we have a fallback in case mapping did not succeed.
(You could also provide the `packageWithBaseClasses` as a fallback.) That way, the tests
generated from `src/test/resources/contract/com/` contracts extend the
`com.example.ComBase`, whereas the rest of the tests extend `com.example.FooBase`.

[[gradle-invoking-generated-tests]]
==== Invoking Generated Tests

To ensure that the provider side is compliant with defined contracts, you need to invoke:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
./gradlew generateContractTests test
----

[[gradle-pushing-stubs-to-scm]]
==== Pushing stubs to SCM

If you're using the SCM repository to keep the contracts and
stubs, you might want to automate the step of pushing stubs to
the repository. To do that, it's enough to call the `pushStubsToScm`
task. Example:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
$ ./gradlew pushStubsToScm
----

Under <<scm-stub-downloader>> you can find all possible
configuration options that you can pass either via
the `contractsProperties` field e.g. `contracts { contractsProperties = [foo:"bar"] }`,
via `contractsProperties` method e.g. `contracts { contractsProperties([foo:"bar"]) }`,
a system property or an environment variable.

[[gradle-consumer]]
==== Spring Cloud Contract Verifier on the Consumer Side

In a consuming service, you need to configure the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier plugin
in exactly the same way as in case of provider. If you do not want to use Stub Runner
then you need to copy contracts stored in `src/test/resources/contracts` and generate
WireMock JSON stubs using:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
./gradlew generateClientStubs
----

NOTE: The `stubsOutputDir` option has to be set for stub generation to work.

When present, JSON stubs can be used in automated tests of consuming a service.

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
@ContextConfiguration(loader == SpringApplicationContextLoader, classes == Application)
class LoanApplicationServiceSpec extends Specification {

 @ClassRule
 @Shared
 WireMockClassRule wireMockRule == new WireMockClassRule()

 @Autowired
 LoanApplicationService sut

 def 'should successfully apply for loan'() {
   given:
 	LoanApplication application =
			new LoanApplication(client: new Client(clientPesel: '12345678901'), amount: 123.123)
   when:
	LoanApplicationResult loanApplication == sut.loanApplication(application)
   then:
	loanApplication.loanApplicationStatus == LoanApplicationStatus.LOAN_APPLIED
	loanApplication.rejectionReason == null
 }
}
----

`LoanApplication` makes a call to `FraudDetection` service. This request is handled by a
WireMock server configured with stubs generated by Spring Cloud Contract Verifier.

[[maven-project]]
=== Maven Project

[[maven-add-plugin]]
==== Add maven plugin

Add the Spring Cloud Contract BOM in a fashion similar to this:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{standalone_samples_path}/http-server/pom.xml[tags=contract_bom,indent=0]
----

Next, add the `Spring Cloud Contract Verifier` Maven plugin:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{standalone_samples_path}/http-server/pom.xml[tags=contract_maven_plugin,indent=0]
----

You can read more in the
https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin/[Spring
Cloud Contract Maven Plugin Documentation].

[[maven-rest-assured]]
==== Maven and Rest Assured 2.0

By default, Rest Assured 3.x is added to the classpath. However, you can use Rest
Assured 2.x by adding it to the plugins classpath, as shown here:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${spring-cloud-contract.version}</version>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <packageWithBaseClasses>com.example</packageWithBaseClasses>
    </configuration>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-verifier</artifactId>
            <version>${spring-cloud-contract.version}</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
           <groupId>com.jayway.restassured</groupId>
           <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
           <version>2.5.0</version>
           <scope>compile</scope>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
           <groupId>com.jayway.restassured</groupId>
           <artifactId>spring-mock-mvc</artifactId>
           <version>2.5.0</version>
           <scope>compile</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>

<dependencies>
    <!-- all dependencies -->
    <!-- you can exclude rest-assured from spring-cloud-contract-verifier -->
    <dependency>
       <groupId>com.jayway.restassured</groupId>
       <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
       <version>2.5.0</version>
       <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
       <groupId>com.jayway.restassured</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-mock-mvc</artifactId>
       <version>2.5.0</version>
       <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

That way, the plugin automatically sees that Rest Assured 3.x is present on the classpath
and modifies the imports accordingly.

[[maven-snapshot-versions]]
==== Snapshot versions for Maven

For Snapshot and Milestone versions, you have to add the following section to your
`pom.xml`, as shown here:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{standalone_samples_path}/http-server/pom.xml[tags=repos,indent=0]
----

[[maven-add-stubs]]
==== Add stubs

By default, Spring Cloud Contract Verifier is looking for stubs in the
`src/test/resources/contracts` directory. The directory containing stub definitions is
treated as a class name, and each stub definition is treated as a single test. We assume
that it contains at least one directory to be used as test class name. If there is more
than one level of nested directories, all except the last one is used as package name.
For example, with following structure:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
src/test/resources/contracts/myservice/shouldCreateUser.groovy
src/test/resources/contracts/myservice/shouldReturnUser.groovy
----

Spring Cloud Contract Verifier creates a test class named `defaultBasePackage.MyService`
with two methods

* `shouldCreateUser()`
* `shouldReturnUser()`

[[maven-run-plugin]]
==== Run plugin

The plugin goal `generateTests` is assigned to be invoked in the phase called
`generate-test-sources`. If you want it to be part of your build process, you need not do
anything. If you just want to generate tests, invoke the `generateTests` goal.

[[maven-configure-plugin]]
==== Configure plugin

To change the default configuration, just add a `configuration` section to the plugin
definition or the `execution` definition, as shown here:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>

    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

[[maven-configuration-options]]
==== Configuration Options

* *testMode*: Defines the mode for acceptance tests. By default, the mode is MockMvc,
which is based on Spring's MockMvc. It can also be changed to *JaxRsClient* or to
*Explicit* for real HTTP calls.
* *basePackageForTests*: Specifies the base package for all generated tests. If not set,
the value is picked from `baseClassForTests`'s package and from `packageWithBaseClasses`.
If neither of these values are set, then the value is set to
`org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.tests`.
* *ruleClassForTests*: Specifies a rule that should be added to the generated test
classes.
* *baseClassForTests*: Creates a base class for all generated tests. By default, if you
use Spock classes, the class is `spock.lang.Specification`.
* *contractsDirectory*: Specifies a directory containing contracts written with the
GroovyDSL. The default directory is `/src/test/resources/contracts`.
* *testFramework*: Specifies the target test framework to be used. Currently, Spock and
JUnit are supported with JUnit being the default framework
* *packageWithBaseClasses*: Defines a package where all the base classes reside. This
setting takes precedence over *baseClassForTests*. The convention is such that, if you
have a contract under (for example) `src/test/resources/contract/foo/bar/baz/` and set
the value of the `packageWithBaseClasses` property to `com.example.base`, then Spring
Cloud Contract Verifier assumes that there is a `BarBazBase` class under the
`com.example.base` package. In other words, the system takes the last two parts of the
package, if they exist, and forms a class with a `Base` suffix.
* *baseClassMappings*: Specifies a list of base class mappings that provide
`contractPackageRegex`, which is checked against the package where the contract is
located, and `baseClassFQN`, which maps to the fully qualified name of the base class for
the matched contract. For example, if you have a contract under
`src/test/resources/contract/foo/bar/baz/` and map the property
`.* -> com.example.base.BaseClass`, then the test class generated from these contracts
extends `com.example.base.BaseClass`. This setting takes precedence over
*packageWithBaseClasses* and *baseClassForTests*.
* *contractsProperties*: a map containing properties to be passed to Spring Cloud Contract
components. Those properties might be used by e.g. inbuilt or custom Stub Downloaders.

If you want to download your contract definitions from a Maven repository, you can use
the following options:

* *contractDependency*: The contract dependency that contains all the packaged contracts.
* *contractsPath*: The path to the concrete contracts in the JAR with packaged contracts.
Defaults to `groupid/artifactid` where `gropuid` is slash separated.
* *contractsMode*: Picks the mode in which stubs will be found and registered
* *contractsSnapshotCheckSkip*: If `true` then will not assert whether a stub / contract
JAR was downloaded from local or remote location
* *deleteStubsAfterTest*: If set to `false` will not remove any downloaded
contracts from temporary directories
* *contractsRepositoryUrl*: URL to a repo with the artifacts that have contracts. If it is not provided,
use the current Maven ones.
* *contractsRepositoryUsername*: The user name to be used to connect to the repo with contracts.
* *contractsRepositoryPassword*: The password to be used to connect to the repo with contracts.
* *contractsRepositoryProxyHost*: The proxy host to be used to connect to the repo with contracts.
* *contractsRepositoryProxyPort*: The proxy port to be used to connect to the repo with contracts.

We cache only non-snapshot, explicitly provided versions (for example
`+` or `1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` won't get cached). By default, this feature is turned on.

[[maven-single-base]]
==== Single Base Class for All Tests

When using Spring Cloud Contract Verifier in default MockMvc, you need to create a base
specification for all generated acceptance tests. In this class, you need to point to an
endpoint, which should be verified.

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
package org.mycompany.tests

import org.mycompany.ExampleSpringController
import com.jayway.restassured.module.mockmvc.RestAssuredMockMvc
import spock.lang.Specification

class MvcSpec extends Specification {
  def setup() {
   RestAssuredMockMvc.standaloneSetup(new ExampleSpringController())
  }
}
----

You can also setup the whole context if necessary.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
import io.restassured.module.mockmvc.RestAssuredMockMvc;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.context.WebApplicationContext;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT, classes = SomeConfig.class, properties="some=property")
public abstract class BaseTestClass {

	@Autowired
	WebApplicationContext context;

	@Before
	public void setup() {
		RestAssuredMockMvc.webAppContextSetup(this.context);
	}
}
----

If you use `EXPLICIT` mode, you can use a base class to initialize the whole tested app
similarly, as you might find in regular integration tests.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
import io.restassured.RestAssured;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.boot.web.server.LocalServerPort
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.context.WebApplicationContext;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT, classes = SomeConfig.class, properties="some=property")
public abstract class BaseTestClass {

	@LocalServerPort
	int port;

	@Before
	public void setup() {
		RestAssured.baseURI = "http://localhost:" + this.port;
	}
}
----

If you use the `JAXRSCLIENT` mode, this base class should also contain a `protected WebTarget webTarget` field. Right
now, the only option to test the JAX-RS API is to start a web server.

[[maven-different-base]]
==== Different base classes for contracts

If your base classes differ between contracts, you can tell the Spring Cloud Contract
plugin which class should get extended by the autogenerated tests. You have two options:

* Follow a convention by providing the `packageWithBaseClasses`
* provide explicit mapping via `baseClassMappings`

*By Convention*

The convention is such that if you have a contract under (for example)
`src/test/resources/contract/foo/bar/baz/` and set the value of the
`packageWithBaseClasses` property to `com.example.base`, then Spring Cloud Contract
Verifier assumes that there is a `BarBazBase` class under the `com.example.base` package.
In other words, the system takes the last two parts of the package, if they exist, and
forms a class with a `Base` suffix. This rule takes precedence over *baseClassForTests*.
Here is an example of how it works in the `contracts` closure:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{plugins_path}/spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin/src/test/projects/basic-generated-baseclass/pom.xml[tags=convention,indent=0]
----

*By Mapping*

You can manually map a regular expression of the contract's package to fully qualified
name of the base class for the matched contract. You have to provide a list called
`baseClassMappings` that consists `baseClassMapping` objects that takes a
`contractPackageRegex` to `baseClassFQN` mapping. Consider the following example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{plugins_path}/spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin/src/test/projects/basic-baseclass-from-mappings/pom.xml[tags=mapping,indent=0]
----

Assume that you have contracts under these two locations:
* `src/test/resources/contract/com/`
* `src/test/resources/contract/foo/`

By providing the `baseClassForTests`, we have a fallback in case mapping did not succeed.
(You can also provide the `packageWithBaseClasses` as a fallback.) That way, the tests
generated from `src/test/resources/contract/com/` contracts extend the
`com.example.ComBase`, whereas the rest of the tests extend `com.example.FooBase`.

[[maven-invoking-generated-tests]]
==== Invoking generated tests

The Spring Cloud Contract Maven Plugin generates verification code in a directory called
`/generated-test-sources/contractVerifier` and attaches this directory to `testCompile`
goal.

For Groovy Spock code, use the following:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<plugin>
	<groupId>org.codehaus.gmavenplus</groupId>
	<artifactId>gmavenplus-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>1.5</version>
	<executions>
		<execution>
			<goals>
				<goal>testCompile</goal>
			</goals>
		</execution>
	</executions>
	<configuration>
		<testSources>
			<testSource>
				<directory>${project.basedir}/src/test/groovy</directory>
				<includes>
					<include>**/*.groovy</include>
				</includes>
			</testSource>
			<testSource>
				<directory>${project.build.directory}/generated-test-sources/contractVerifier</directory>
				<includes>
					<include>**/*.groovy</include>
				</includes>
			</testSource>
		</testSources>
	</configuration>
</plugin>
----

To ensure that provider side is compliant with defined contracts, you need to invoke
`mvn generateTest test`.

[[maven-pushing-stubs-to-scm]]
==== Pushing stubs to SCM

If you're using the SCM repository to keep the contracts and
stubs, you might want to automate the step of pushing stubs to
the repository. To do that, it's enough to add the `pushStubsToScm`
goal. Example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${spring-cloud-contract.version}</version>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <!-- Base class mappings etc. -->

        <!-- We want to pick contracts from a Git repository -->
        <contractsRepositoryUrl>git://https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/spring-cloud-contract-nodejs-contracts-git.git</contractsRepositoryUrl>

        <!-- We reuse the contract dependency section to set up the path
        to the folder that contains the contract definitions. In our case the
        path will be /groupId/artifactId/version/contracts -->
        <contractDependency>
            <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
            <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
            <version>${project.version}</version>
        </contractDependency>

        <!-- The contracts mode can't be classpath -->
        <contractsMode>REMOTE</contractsMode>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <phase>package</phase>
            <goals>
                <!-- By default we will not push the stubs back to SCM,
                you have to explicitly add it as a goal -->
                <goal>pushStubsToScm</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

Under <<scm-stub-downloader>> you can find all possible
configuration options that you can pass either via
the `<configuration><contractProperties>` map, a system property
or an environment variable.

=== Stubs and Transitive Dependencies

The Maven and Gradle plugin that add the tasks that create the stubs jar for you. One
problem that arises is that, when reusing the stubs, you can mistakenly import all of
that stub's dependencies. When building a Maven artifact, even though you have a couple
of different jars, all of them share one pom:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075506-1-stubs.jar
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075506-1-stubs.jar.sha1
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075655-2-stubs.jar
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075655-2-stubs.jar.sha1
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.pom
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT-stubs.jar
├── ...
└── ...
----

There are three possibilities of working with those dependencies so as not to have any
issues with transitive dependencies:

* Mark all application dependencies as optional
* Create a separate artifactid for the stubs
* Exclude dependencies on the consumer side

*Mark all application dependencies as optional*

If, in the `github-webhook` application, you mark all of your dependencies as optional,
when you include the `github-webhook` stubs in another application (or when that
dependency gets downloaded by Stub Runner) then, since all of the dependencies are
optional, they will not get downloaded.

*Create a separate `artifactid` for the stubs*

If you create a separate `artifactid`, then you can set it up in whatever way you wish.
For example, you might decide to have no dependencies at all.

*Exclude dependencies on the consumer side*

As a consumer, if you add the stub dependency to your classpath, you can explicitly
exclude the unwanted dependencies.

=== CI Server setup

When fetching stubs / contracts in a CI, shared environment, what might happen is that
both the producer and the consumer reuse the same local Maven repository. Due to this,
the framework, responsible for downloading a stub JAR from remote location,
can't decide which JAR should be picked, local or remote one. That caused
the `"The artifact was found in the local repository but you have explicitly
stated that it should be downloaded from a remote one"` exception
and failed the build.

For such cases we're introducing the property and plugin setup mechanism:

- via `stubrunner.snapshot-check-skip` system property
- via `STUBRUNNER_SNAPSHOT_CHECK_SKIP` environment variable

if either of these values is set to `true`, then the stub downloader will not
verify the origin of the downloaded JAR.

For the plugins you need to set the `contractsSnapshotSkipCheck` property
to `true`.

=== Scenarios

You can handle scenarios with Spring Cloud Contract Verifier. All you need to do is to
stick to the proper naming convention while creating your contracts. The convention
requires including an order number followed by an underscore. This will work regardles
 of whether you're working with YAML or Groovy. Example:

[source,indent=0]
----
my_contracts_dir\
  scenario1\
    1_login.groovy
    2_showCart.groovy
    3_logout.groovy
----

Such a tree causes Spring Cloud Contract Verifier to generate WireMock's scenario with a
name of `scenario1` and the three following steps:

. login marked as `Started` pointing to...
. showCart marked as `Step1` pointing to...
. logout marked as `Step2` which will close the scenario.

More details about WireMock scenarios can be found at
http://wiremock.org/stateful-behaviour.html[http://wiremock.org/stateful-behaviour.html]

Spring Cloud Contract Verifier also generates tests with a guaranteed order of execution.

[[docker-project]]
=== Docker Project

We're publishing a `springcloud/spring-cloud-contract` Docker image
that contains a project that will generate tests and execute them in `EXPLICIT` mode
against a running application.

TIP: The `EXPLICIT` mode means that the tests generated from contracts will send
real requests and not the mocked ones.

==== Short intro to Maven, JARs and Binary storage

Since the Docker image can be used by non JVM projects, it's good to
explain the basic terms behind Spring Cloud Contract packaging defaults.

Part of the following definitions were taken from the https://maven.apache.org/glossary.html[Maven Glossary]

- `Project`: Maven thinks in terms of projects. Everything that you
will build are projects. Those projects follow a well defined
“Project Object Model”. Projects can depend on other projects,
in which case the latter are called “dependencies”. A project may
consistent of several subprojects, however these subprojects are still
treated equally as projects.
- `Artifact`: An artifact is something that is either produced or used
by a project. Examples of artifacts produced by Maven for a project
include: JARs, source and binary distributions. Each artifact
is uniquely identified by a group id and an artifact ID which is
unique within a group.
- `JAR`: JAR stands for Java ARchive. It's a format based on
the ZIP file format. Spring Cloud Contract packages the contracts and generated
stubs in a JAR file.
- `GroupId`: A group ID is a universally unique identifier for a project.
While this is often just the project name (eg. commons-collections),
it is helpful to use a fully-qualified package name to distinguish it
from other projects with a similar name (eg. org.apache.maven).
Typically, when published to the Artifact Manager, the `GroupId` will get
slash separated and form part of the URL. E.g. for group id `com.example`
and artifact id `application` would be `/com/example/application/`.
- `Classifier`: The Maven dependency notation looks as follows:
`groupId:artifactId:version:classifier`. The classifier is additional suffix
passed to the dependency. E.g. `stubs`, `sources`. The same dependency
e.g. `com.example:application` can produce multiple artifacts that
differ from each other with the classifier.
- `Artifact manager`: When you generate binaries / sources / packages, you would
like them to be available for others to download / reference or reuse. In case
of the JVM world those artifacts would be JARs, for Ruby these are gems
and for Docker those would be Docker images. You can store those artifacts
in a manager. Examples of such managers can be https://jfrog.com/artifactory/[Artifactory]
or http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/[Nexus].

==== How it works

The image searches for contracts under the `/contracts` folder.
The output from running the tests will be available under
`/spring-cloud-contract/build` folder (it's useful for debugging
purposes).

It's enough for you to mount your contracts, pass the environment variables
 and the image will:

- generate the contract tests
- execute the tests against the provided URL
- generate the http://wiremock.org[WireMock] stubs
- (optional - turned on by default) publish the stubs to a Artifact Manager

===== Environment Variables

The Docker image requires some environment variables to point to
your running application, to the Artifact manager instance etc.

- `PROJECT_GROUP` - your project's group id. Defaults to `com.example`
- `PROJECT_VERSION` - your project's version. Defaults to `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`
- `PROJECT_NAME` - artifact id. Defaults to `example`
- `REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL` - URL of your Artifact Manager. Defaults to `http://localhost:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local`
which is the default URL of https://jfrog.com/artifactory/[Artifactory] running locally
- `REPO_WITH_BINARIES_USERNAME` - (optional) username when the Artifact Manager is secured
- `REPO_WITH_BINARIES_PASSWORD` - (optional) password when the Artifact Manager is secured
- `PUBLISH_ARTIFACTS` - if set to `true` then will publish artifact to binary storage. Defaults to `true`.

These environment variables are used when contracts lay in an external repository. To enable
this feature you must set the `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_ARTIFACT_ID` environment variable.

- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_GROUP_ID` - group id of the project with contracts. Defaults to `com.example`
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_ARTIFACT_ID`- artifact id of the project with contracts.
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_CLASSIFIER`- classifier of the project with contracts. Empty by default
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_VERSION` - version of the project with contracts. Defaults to `+`, equivalent to picking the latest
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL` - URL of your Artifact Manager. Defaults to value of `REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL` env var.
If that's not set, defaults to `http://localhost:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local`
which is the default URL of https://jfrog.com/artifactory/[Artifactory] running locally
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_PATH` - path to contracts for the given project, inside the project with contracts.
Defaults to slash separated `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_GROUP_ID` concatenated with `/` and `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_ARTIFACT_ID`. E.g.
for group id `foo.bar` and artifact id `baz`, would result in `foo/bar/baz` contracts path.
- `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_WORK_OFFLINE` - if set to `true` then will retrieve artifact with contracts
from the container's `.m2`. Mount your local `.m2` as a volume available at the container's `/root/.m2` path.
You must not set both `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_WORK_OFFLINE` and `EXTERNAL_CONTRACTS_REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL`.


These environment variables are used when tests are executed:

- `APPLICATION_BASE_URL` - url against which tests should be executed.
Remember that it has to be accessible from the Docker container (e.g. `localhost`
will not work)
- `APPLICATION_USERNAME` - (optional) username for basic authentication to your application
- `APPLICATION_PASSWORD` - (optional) password for basic authentication to your application

==== Example of usage

Let's take a look at a simple MVC application

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/spring-cloud-contract-nodejs
$ cd bookstore
```

The contracts are available under `/contracts` folder.

[[docker-server-side]]
==== Server side (nodejs)

Since we want to run tests, we could just execute:

```bash
$ npm test
```

however, for learning purposes, let's split it into pieces:

```bash
# Stop docker infra (nodejs, artifactory)
$ ./stop_infra.sh
# Start docker infra (nodejs, artifactory)
$ ./setup_infra.sh

# Kill & Run app
$ pkill -f "node app"
$ nohup node app &

# Prepare environment variables
$ SC_CONTRACT_DOCKER_VERSION="..."
$ APP_IP="192.168.0.100"
$ APP_PORT="3000"
$ ARTIFACTORY_PORT="8081"
$ APPLICATION_BASE_URL="http://${APP_IP}:${APP_PORT}"
$ ARTIFACTORY_URL="http://${APP_IP}:${ARTIFACTORY_PORT}/artifactory/libs-release-local"
$ CURRENT_DIR="$( pwd )"
$ CURRENT_FOLDER_NAME=${PWD##*/}
$ PROJECT_VERSION="0.0.1.RELEASE"

# Execute contract tests
$ docker run  --rm -e "APPLICATION_BASE_URL=${APPLICATION_BASE_URL}" -e "PUBLISH_ARTIFACTS=true" -e "PROJECT_NAME=${CURRENT_FOLDER_NAME}" -e "REPO_WITH_BINARIES_URL=${ARTIFACTORY_URL}" -e "PROJECT_VERSION=${PROJECT_VERSION}" -v "${CURRENT_DIR}/contracts/:/contracts:ro" -v "${CURRENT_DIR}/node_modules/spring-cloud-contract/output:/spring-cloud-contract-output/" springcloud/spring-cloud-contract:"${SC_CONTRACT_DOCKER_VERSION}"

# Kill app
$ pkill -f "node app"
```

What will happen is that via bash scripts:

- infrastructure will be set up (MongoDb, Artifactory).
In real life scenario you would just run the NodeJS application
with mocked database. In this example we want to show how we can
benefit from Spring Cloud Contract in no time.
- due to those constraints the contracts also represent the
stateful situation
** first request is a `POST` that causes data to get inserted to the database
** second request is a `GET` that returns a list of data with 1 previously inserted element
- the NodeJS application will be started (on port `3000`)
- contract tests will be generated via Docker and tests
will be executed against the running application
** the contracts will be taken from `/contracts` folder.
** the output of the test execution is available under
`node_modules/spring-cloud-contract/output`.
- the stubs will be uploaded to Artifactory. You can check them out
under http://localhost:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/example/bookstore/0.0.1.RELEASE/ .
The stubs will be here http://localhost:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/example/bookstore/0.0.1.RELEASE/bookstore-0.0.1.RELEASE-stubs.jar.
