== Spring Cloud Contract Verifier Setup

You can set up Spring Cloud Contract Verifier in either of two ways

* <<gradle-project,As a Gradle project>>
* <<maven-project,As a Maven project>>

[[gradle-project]]
=== Gradle Project

To learn how to set up the Gradle project for Spring Cloud Contract Verifier, read the
following sections:

* <<gradle-prerequisites>>
* <<gradle-add-gradle-plugin>>
* <<gradle-and-rest-assured>>
* <<gradle-snapshot-versions>>
* <<gradle-add-stubs>>
* <<gradle-default-setup>>
* <<gradle-configure-plugin>>
* <<gradle-configuration-options>>
* <<gradle-single-base-class>>
* <<gradle-different-base-classes>>
* <<gradle-invoking-generated-tests>>
* <<gradle-consumer>>

[[gradle-prerequisites]]
==== Prerequisites

In order to use Spring Cloud Contract Verifier with WireMock, you muse use either a
Gradle or a Maven plugin.

WARNING: If you want to use Spock in your projects, you must add separately the
`spock-core` and `spock-spring` modules. Check http://spockframework.github.io/[Spock
docs for more information]

[[gradle-add-gradle-plugin]]
==== Add Gradle Plugin with Dependencies

To add a Gradle plugin with dependencies, use code similar to this:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
buildscript {
	repositories {
		mavenCentral()
	}
	dependencies {
	    classpath "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:${springboot_version}"
		classpath "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin:${verifier_version}"
	}
}

apply plugin: 'groovy'
apply plugin: 'spring-cloud-contract'

dependencyManagement {
	imports {
		mavenBom "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-contract-dependencies:${verifier_version}"
	}
}

dependencies {
	testCompile 'org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:2.4.6'
	// example with adding Spock core and Spock Spring
	testCompile 'org.spockframework:spock-core:1.0-groovy-2.4'
	testCompile 'org.spockframework:spock-spring:1.0-groovy-2.4'
	testCompile 'org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier'
}
----

[[gradle-and-rest-assured]]
==== Gradle and Rest Assured 2.0

By default, Rest Assured 3.x is added to the classpath. However, to use Rest Assured 2.x
you can add it to the plugins classpath, as shown here:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
buildscript {
	repositories {
		mavenCentral()
	}
	dependencies {
	    classpath "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:${springboot_version}"
		classpath "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin:${verifier_version}"
		classpath "com.jayway.restassured:rest-assured:2.5.0"
		classpath "com.jayway.restassured:spring-mock-mvc:2.5.0"
	}
}

depenendencies {
    // all dependencies
    // you can exclude rest-assured from spring-cloud-contract-verifier
    testCompile "com.jayway.restassured:rest-assured:2.5.0"
    testCompile "com.jayway.restassured:spring-mock-mvc:2.5.0"
}
----

That way, the plugin automatically sees that Rest Assured 2.x is present on the classpath
and modifies the imports accordingly.

[[gradle-snapshot-versions]]
==== Snapshot Versions for Gradle

Add the additional snapshot repository to your build.gradle to use snapshot versions,
which are automatically uploaded after every successful build, as shown here:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{standalone_samples_path}/http-server/build.gradle[tags=repos,indent=0]
}
----
[[gradle-add-stubs]]
==== Add stubs

By default, Spring Cloud Contract Verifier is looking for stubs in the
`src/test/resources/contracts` directory.

The directory containing stub definitions is treated as a class name, and each stub
definition is treated as a single test. Spring Cloud Contract Verifier assumes that it
contains at  least one level of directories that are to be used as the test class name.
If more than  one level of nested directories is present, all except the last one is used
as the package name. For example, with following structure:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
src/test/resources/contracts/myservice/shouldCreateUser.groovy
src/test/resources/contracts/myservice/shouldReturnUser.groovy
----

Spring Cloud Contract Verifier creates a test class named `defaultBasePackage.MyService`
with two methods:

 - `shouldCreateUser()`
 - `shouldReturnUser()`

[[gradle-run-plugin]]
==== Run the Plugin

The plugin registers itself to be invoked before a `check` task. If you want it to be
part of your build process, you need to do nothing more. If you just want to generate
tests, invoke the `generateContractTests` task.

[[gradle-default-setup]]
==== Default Setup

The default Gradle Plugin setup creates the following Gradle part of the build (in
pseudocode):

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
contracts {
    targetFramework = 'JUNIT'
    testMode = 'MockMvc'
    generatedTestSourcesDir = project.file("${project.buildDir}/generated-test-sources/contracts")
    contractsDslDir = "${project.rootDir}/src/test/resources/contracts"
    basePackageForTests = 'org.springframework.cloud.verifier.tests'
    stubsOutputDir = project.file("${project.buildDir}/stubs")

    // the following properties are used when you want to provide where the JAR with contract lays
    contractDependency {
        stringNotation = ''
    }
    contractsPath = ''
    contractsWorkOffline = false
    contractRepository {
        cacheDownloadedContracts(true)
    }
}

tasks.create(type: Jar, name: 'verifierStubsJar', dependsOn: 'generateClientStubs') {
    baseName = project.name
    classifier = contracts.stubsSuffix
    from contractVerifier.stubsOutputDir
}

project.artifacts {
    archives task
}

tasks.create(type: Copy, name: 'copyContracts') {
    from contracts.contractsDslDir
    into contracts.stubsOutputDir
}

verifierStubsJar.dependsOn 'copyContracts'

publishing {
    publications {
        stubs(MavenPublication) {
            artifactId project.name
            artifact verifierStubsJar
        }
    }
}
----

[[gradle-configure-plugin]]
==== Configure Plugin

To change the default configuration, add a `contracts` snippet to your Gradle config, as
shown here:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
contracts {
	testMode = 'MockMvc'
	baseClassForTests = 'org.mycompany.tests'
	generatedTestSourcesDir = project.file('src/generatedContract')
}
----

[[gradle-configuration-options]]
==== Configuration Options

* *testMode*: Defines the mode for acceptance tests. By default, the mode is MockMvc,
which is based on Spring's MockMvc. It can also be changed to *JaxRsClient* or to
*Explicit* for real HTTP calls.
* *imports*: Creates an array with imports that should be included in generated tests
(for example ['org.myorg.Matchers']). By default, it creates an empty array.
* *staticImports*: Creates an array with static imports that should be included in
generated tests(for example ['org.myorg.Matchers.*']). By default, it creates an empty
array.
* *basePackageForTests*: Specifies the base package for all generated tests. If not set,
the value is picked from `baseClassForTests`'s package and from `packageWithBaseClasses`.
If neither of these values are set, then the value is set to
`org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.tests`.
* *baseClassForTests*: Creates a base class for all generated tests. By default, if you
use Spock classes, the class is `spock.lang.Specification`.
* *packageWithBaseClasses*: Defines a package where all the base classes reside. This
setting takes precedence over *baseClassForTests*.
* *baseClassMappings*: Explicitly maps a contract package to a FQN of a base class. This
setting takes precedence over *packageWithBaseClasses* and *baseClassForTests*.
* *ruleClassForTests*: Specifies a rule that should be added to the generated test
classes.
* *ignoredFiles*: Uses an `Antmatcher` to allow defining stub files for which processing
should be skipped. By default, it is an empty array.
* *contractsDslDir*: Specifies the directory containing contracts written using the
GroovyDSL. By default, its value is `$rootDir/src/test/resources/contracts`.
* *generatedTestSourcesDir*: Specifies the test source directory where tests generated
from the Groovy DSL should be placed. By default its value is
`$buildDir/generated-test-sources/contractVerifier`.
* *stubsOutputDir*: Specifies the directory where the generated WireMock stubs from
the Groovy DSL should be placed.
* *targetFramework*: Specifies the target test framework to be used. Currently, Spock and
JUnit are supported with JUnit being the default framework.

The following properties are used when you want to specify the location of the JAR
containing the contracts:
* *contractDependency*: Specifies the Dependency that provides
`groupid:artifactid:version:classifier` coordinates. You can use the `contractDependency`
closure to set it up.
* *contractsPath*: Specifies the path to the jar. If contract dependencies are
 downloaded, the path defaults to `groupid/artifactid` where `groupid` is slash
 separated. Otherwise, it scans contracts under the provided directory.
* *contractsWorkOffline*: Specifies whether to download the dependencies each time, so
that you can work online. In other words, it specifies whether to reuses the local Maven
repo.

[[gradle-single-base-class]]
==== Single Base Class for All Tests

When using Spring Cloud Contract Verifier in default MockMvc, you need to create a base
specification for all generated acceptance tests. In this class, you need to point to an
endpoint, which should be verified.

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{plugins_path}/spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin/src/test/resources/functionalTest/bootSimple/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/twitter/places/BaseMockMvcSpec.groovy[tags=base_class,indent=0]
----

If you use `Explicit` mode, you can use a base class to initialize the whole tested app
as you might see in regular integration tests. If you use the `JAXRSCLIENT` mode, this
base class should also contain a `protected WebTarget webTarget` field. Right now, the
only option to test the JAX-RS API is to start a web server.

[[gradle-different-base-classes]]
==== Different Base Classes for Contracts

If your base classes differ between contracts, you can tell the Spring Cloud Contract
plugin which class should get extended by the autogenerated tests. You have two options:

* Follow a convention by providing the `packageWithBaseClasses`
* Provide explicit mapping via `baseClassMappings`

*By Convention*

The convention is such that if you have a contract under (for example)
`src/test/resources/contract/foo/bar/baz/` and set the value of the
`packageWithBaseClasses` property to `com.example.base`, then Spring Cloud Contract
Verifier assumes that there is a `BarBazBase` class under the `com.example.base` package.
In other words, the system takes the last two parts of the package, if they exist, and
forms a class with a `Base` suffix. This rule takes precedence over *baseClassForTests*.
Here is an example of how it works in the `contracts` closure:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{plugins_path}/spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/plugin/ContractVerifierSpec.groovy[tags=package_with_base_classes,indent=0]
----

*By Mapping*

You can manually map a regular expression of the contract's package to fully qualified
name of the base class for the matched contract. You have to provide a list called
`baseClassMappings` that consists `baseClassMapping` objects that takes a
`contractPackageRegex` to `baseClassFQN` mapping. Consider the following example:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{plugins_path}/spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/plugin/ContractVerifierSpec.groovy[tags=base_class_mappings,indent=0]
----

Let's assume that you have contracts under
 - `src/test/resources/contract/com/`
 - `src/test/resources/contract/foo/`

By providing the `baseClassForTests`, we have a fallback in case mapping did not succeed.
(You could also provide the `packageWithBaseClasses` as a fallback.) That way, the tests
generated from `src/test/resources/contract/com/` contracts extend the
`com.example.ComBase`, whereas the rest of the tests extend `com.example.FooBase`.

[[gradle-invoking-generated-tests]]
==== Invoking Generated Tests

To ensure that the provider side is compliant with defined contracts, you need to invoke:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
./gradlew generateContractTests test
----

[[gradle-consumer]]
==== Spring Cloud Contract Verifier on the Consumer Side

In a consuming service, you need to configure the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier plugin
in exactly the same way as in case of provider. If you do not want to use Stub Runner
then you need to copy contracts stored in `src/test/resources/contracts` and generate
WireMock JSON stubs using:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
./gradlew generateClientStubs
----

NOTE: The `stubsOutputDir` option has to be set for stub generation to work.

When present, JSON stubs can be used in automated tests of consuming a service.

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
@ContextConfiguration(loader == SpringApplicationContextLoader, classes == Application)
class LoanApplicationServiceSpec extends Specification {

 @ClassRule
 @Shared
 WireMockClassRule wireMockRule == new WireMockClassRule()

 @Autowired
 LoanApplicationService sut

 def 'should successfully apply for loan'() {
   given:
 	LoanApplication application =
			new LoanApplication(client: new Client(clientPesel: '12345678901'), amount: 123.123)
   when:
	LoanApplicationResult loanApplication == sut.loanApplication(application)
   then:
	loanApplication.loanApplicationStatus == LoanApplicationStatus.LOAN_APPLIED
	loanApplication.rejectionReason == null
 }
}
----

`LoanApplication` makes a call to `FraudDetection` service. This request is handled by a
WireMock server configured with stubs generated by Spring Cloud Contract Verifier.

[[maven-project]]
=== Maven Project

To learn how to set up the Maven project for Spring Cloud Contract Verifier, read the
following sections:

* <<maven-add-plugin>>
* <<maven-rest-assured>>
* <<maven-snapshot-versions>>
* <<maven-add-stubs>>
* <<maven-run-plugin>>

[[maven-add-plugin]]
==== Add maven plugin

Add the Spring Cloud Contract BOM in a fashion similar to this:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{standalone_samples_path}/http-server/pom.xml[tags=contract_bom,indent=0]
----

Next, add the `Spring Cloud Contract Verifier` Maven plugin:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{standalone_samples_path}/http-server/pom.xml[tags=contract_maven_plugin,indent=0]
----

You can read more in the
https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin/[Spring
Cloud Contract Maven Plugin Documentation].

[[maven-rest-assured]]
==== Maven and Rest Assured 2.0

By default, Rest Assured 3.x is added to the classpath. However, you can use Rest
Assured 2.x by adding it to the plugins classpath, as shown here:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${spring-cloud-contract.version}</version>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <packageWithBaseClasses>com.example</packageWithBaseClasses>
    </configuration>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-verifier</artifactId>
            <version>${spring-cloud-contract.version}</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
           <groupId>com.jayway.restassured</groupId>
           <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
           <version>2.5.0</version>
           <scope>compile</scope>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
           <groupId>com.jayway.restassured</groupId>
           <artifactId>spring-mock-mvc</artifactId>
           <version>2.5.0</version>
           <scope>compile</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</plugin>

<dependencies>
    <!-- all dependencies -->
    <!-- you can exclude rest-assured from spring-cloud-contract-verifier -->
    <dependency>
       <groupId>com.jayway.restassured</groupId>
       <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
       <version>2.5.0</version>
       <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
       <groupId>com.jayway.restassured</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-mock-mvc</artifactId>
       <version>2.5.0</version>
       <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

That way, the plugin automatically sees that Rest Assured 3.x is present on the classpath
and modifies the imports accordingly.

[[maven-snapshot-versions]]
==== Snapshot versions for Maven

For Snapshot and Milestone versions, you have to add the following section to your
`pom.xml`, as shown here:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{standalone_samples_path}/http-server/pom.xml[tags=repos,indent=0]
----

[[maven-add-stubs]]
==== Add stubs

By default, Spring Cloud Contract Verifier is looking for stubs in the
`src/test/resources/contracts` directory. The directory containing stub definitions is
treated as a class name, and each stub definition is treated as a single test. We assume
that it contains at least one directory to be used as test class name. If there is more
than one level of nested directories, all except the last one is used as package name.
For example, with following structure:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
src/test/resources/contracts/myservice/shouldCreateUser.groovy
src/test/resources/contracts/myservice/shouldReturnUser.groovy
----

Spring Cloud Contract Verifier creates a test class named `defaultBasePackage.MyService`
with two methods

* `shouldCreateUser()`
* `shouldReturnUser()`

[[maven-run-plugin]]
==== Run plugin

The plugin goal `generateTests` is assigned to be invoked in the phase called
`generate-test-sources`. If you want it to be part of your build process, you need not do
anything. If you just want to generate tests, invoke the `generateTests` goal.

[[maven-configure-plugin]]
==== Configure plugin

To change the default configuration, just add a `configuration` section to the plugin
definition or the `execution` definition, as shown here:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <executions>

    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

[[maven-configuration-options]]
==== Configuration Options

* *testMode*: Defines the mode for acceptance tests. By default, the mode is MockMvc,
which is based on Spring's MockMvc. It can also be changed to *JaxRsClient* or to
*Explicit* for real HTTP calls.
* *basePackageForTests*: Specifies the base package for all generated tests. If not set,
the value is picked from `baseClassForTests`'s package and from `packageWithBaseClasses`.
If neither of these values are set, then the value is set to
`org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.tests`.
* *ruleClassForTests*: Specifies a rule that should be added to the generated test
classes.
* *baseClassForTests*: Creates a base class for all generated tests. By default, if you
use Spock classes, the class is `spock.lang.Specification`.
* *contractsDirectory*: Specifies a directory containing contracts written with the
GroovyDSL. The default directory is `/src/test/resources/contracts`.
* *testFramework*: Specifies the target test framework to be used. Currently, Spock and
JUnit are supported with JUnit being the default framework
* *packageWithBaseClasses*: Defines a package where all the base classes reside. This
setting takes precedence over *baseClassForTests*. The convention is such that, if you
have a contract under (for example) `src/test/resources/contract/foo/bar/baz/` and set
the value of the `packageWithBaseClasses` property to `com.example.base`, then Spring
Cloud Contract Verifier assumes that there is a `BarBazBase` class under the
`com.example.base` package. In other words, the system takes the last two parts of the
package, if they exist, and forms a class with a `Base` suffix.
* *baseClassMappings*: Specifies a list of base class mappings that provide
`contractPackageRegex`, which is checked against the package where the contract is
located, and `baseClassFQN`, which maps to the fully qualified name of the base class for
the matched contract. For example, if you have a contract under
`src/test/resources/contract/foo/bar/baz/` and map the property
`.* -> com.example.base.BaseClass`, then the test class generated from these contracts
extends `com.example.base.BaseClass`. This setting takes precedence over
*packageWithBaseClasses* and *baseClassForTests*.

If you want to download your contract definitions from a Maven repository, you can use
the following options:

* *contractDependency*: The contract dependency that contains all the packaged contracts.
* *contractsPath*: The path to the concrete contracts in the JAR with packaged contracts.
Defaults to `groupid/artifactid` where `gropuid` is slash separated.
* *contractsWorkOffline*: Dictates whether the dependencies should be downloaded or the
local Maven artifacts should be reused.
* *contractsRepositoryUrl*: *DEPRECATED PROPERTY - please use the `contractRepository`
closure*: URL to a repo with the artifacts that have contracts. If it is not provided,
use the current Maven ones.
* *contractRepository* - Lets you use a closure where you can define properties related
to repository with contracts.
* *username*: The user name to be used to connect to the repo.
* *password*: The password to be used to connect to the repo.
* *proxyHost*: The proxy host to be used to connect to the repo.
* *proxyPort*: The proxy port to be used to connect to the repo.
* *cacheDownloadedContracts* - Specifies whether to reuse downloaded JARs that contain
contract definitions.

We cache only non-snapshot, explicitly provided versions (for example
`+` or `1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` won't get cached). By default, this feature is turned on.

[[maven-single-base]]
==== Single Base Class for All Tests

When using Spring Cloud Contract Verifier in default MockMvc, you need to create a base
specification for all generated acceptance tests. In this class, you need to point to an
endpoint, which should be verified.

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
package org.mycompany.tests

import org.mycompany.ExampleSpringController
import com.jayway.restassured.module.mockmvc.RestAssuredMockMvc
import spock.lang.Specification

class  MvcSpec extends Specification {
  def setup() {
   RestAssuredMockMvc.standaloneSetup(new ExampleSpringController())
  }
}
----

If you use `Explicit` mode, you can use a base class to initialize the whole tested app
similarly, as you might find in regular integration tests. If you use the `JAXRSCLIENT`
mode, this base class should also contain a `protected WebTarget webTarget` field. Right
now, the only option to test the JAX-RS API is to start a web server.

[[maven-different-base]]

Here is an example of how it works in the `contracts` closure:

name of the base class for the matched contract. You have to provide a list called
`baseClassMappings` that consists `baseClassMapping` objects that takes a
`contractPackageRegex` to `baseClassFQN` mapping. Consider the following example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{plugins_path}/spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin/src/test/projects/basic-baseclass-from-mappings/pom.xml[tags=mapping,indent=0]
----

Assume that you have contracts under these two locations:
* `src/test/resources/contract/com/`
* `src/test/resources/contract/foo/`

By providing the `baseClassForTests`, we have a fallback in case mapping did not succeed.
(You can also provide the `packageWithBaseClasses` as a fallback.) That way, the tests
generated from `src/test/resources/contract/com/` contracts extend the
`com.example.ComBase`, whereas the rest of the tests extend `com.example.FooBase`.

[[maven-invoking-generated-tests]]
==== Invoking generated tests

The Spring Cloud Contract Maven Plugin generates verification code in a directory called
`/generated-test-sources/contractVerifier` and attaches this directory to `testCompile`
goal.

For Groovy Spock code, use the following:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<plugin>
	<groupId>org.codehaus.gmavenplus</groupId>
	<artifactId>gmavenplus-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>1.5</version>

	</configuration>
</plugin>
----

To ensure that provider side is compliant with defined contracts, you need to invoke
`mvn generateTest test`.

[[maven-sts]]
==== Maven Plugin and STS

If you see the following exception while using STS:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/{branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/sts_exception.png[STS Exception]

When you click on the error marker you should see something like this:

==== Spring Cloud Contract Verifier on the Consumer Side

You can also use the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier for the consumer side. To do so, use
the plugin so that it only converts the contracts and generates the stubs. To achieve
that, you need to configure Spring Cloud Contract Verifier plugin in exactly the same way
as you would for a provider. You need to copy contracts stored in
`src/test/resources/contracts` and generate WireMock JSON stubs using the
`mvn generateStubs` command. By default, the generated WireMock mapping is stored in a
directory named `target/mappings`. From these generated mappings, your project should
create additional artifacts with a classifier of `stubs` for easy deployment to the maven
repository.

Here is a sample configuration:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${verifier-plugin.version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>convert</goal>
                <goal>generateStubs</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

When present, JSON stubs can be used in consumer automated tests, as shown here:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
@RunWith(SpringTestRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureStubRunner
public class LoanApplicationServiceTests {

  @Autowired
  LoanApplicationService service;

  @Test
  public void shouldSuccessfullyApplyForLoan() {
    //given:
 	LoanApplication application =
			new LoanApplication(new Client("12345678901"), 123.123);
    //when:
	LoanApplicationResult loanApplication = service.loanApplication(application);
    // then:
	assertThat(loanApplication.loanApplicationStatus).isEqualTo(LoanApplicationStatus.LOAN_APPLIED);
	assertThat(loanApplication.rejectionReason).isNull();
  }
}
----
`LoanApplication` makes a call to the `FraudDetection` service. This request is handled
by a WireMock server configured with stubs generated by the Spring Cloud Contract
Verifier.

=== Stubs and Transitive Dependencies

The Maven and Gradle plugin that add the tasks that create the stubs jar for you. One
problem that arises is that, when reusing the stubs, you can mistakenly import all of
that stub's dependencies. When building a Maven artifact, even though you have a couple
of different jars, all of them share one pom:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075506-1-stubs.jar
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075506-1-stubs.jar.sha1
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075655-2-stubs.jar
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-20160903.075655-2-stubs.jar.sha1
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.pom
├── github-webhook-0.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT-stubs.jar
├── ...
└── ...
----

There are three possibilities of working with those dependencies so as not to have any
issues with transitive dependencies:

* Mark all application dependencies as optional
* Create a separate artifactid for the stubs
* Exclude dependencies on the consumer side

*Mark all application dependencies as optional*

If, in the `github-webhook` application, you mark all of your dependencies as optional,
when you include the `github-webhook` stubs in another application (or when that
dependency gets downloaded by Stub Runner) then, since all of the dependencies are
optional, they will not get downloaded.

*Create a separate `artifactid` for the stubs*

If you create a separate `artifactid`, then you can set it up in whatever way you wish.
For example, you might decide to have no dependencies at all.

*Exclude dependencies on the consumer side*

As a consumer, if you add the stub dependency to your classpath, you can explicitly
exclude the unwanted dependencies.

=== Scenarios

You can handle scenarios with Spring Cloud Contract Verifier. All you need to do is to
stick to the proper naming convention while creating your contracts. The convention
requires including an order number followed by an underscore, as shown in this example:

[source,indent=0]
----
my_contracts_dir\
  scenario1\
    1_login.groovy
    2_showCart.groovy
    3_logout.groovy
----

Such a tree causes Spring Cloud Contract Verifier to generate WireMock's scenario with a
name of `scenario1` and the three following steps:

. login marked as `Started` pointing to...
. showCart marked as `Step1` pointing to...
. logout marked as `Step2` which will close the scenario.

More details about WireMock scenarios can be found at
http://wiremock.org/stateful-behaviour.html[http://wiremock.org/stateful-behaviour.html]

Spring Cloud Contract Verifier also generates tests with a guaranteed order of execution.
