IMPORTANT: The following properties can be passed as a system property (for example, `stubrunner.properties.git.branch`), as an environment variable (for example, `STUBRUNNER_PROPERTIES_GIT_BRANCH`), or as a property inside stub runner's annotation or a JUnit Rule (JUnit 4) or Extension (JUnit 5). In the latter case, you can pass the `git.branch` property instead of `stubrunner.properties.git.branch`.

.Stubrunner Properties Options
|===
|Name | Default | Description

|`stubrunner.properties.git.branch` |  | When using the SCM-based approach, you can customize the branch name to check out.
|`stubrunner.properties.git.commit-message` | Updating project [$project] with stubs | When using the SCM based approach, you can customize the commit message for created stubs. The `$project` text is replaced with the project name.
|`stubrunner.properties.git.no-of-attempts` | `10` | When using the-SCM based approach, you can customize the number of retries to push the stubs to Git.
|`stubrunner.properties.git.username` |  | When using the SCM-based approach, you can pass the username to connect to the git repository.
|`stubrunner.properties.git.password` |  | When using the SCM-based approach, you can pass the password to connect to the git repository.
|`stubrunner.properties.git.wait-between-attempts` | `1000` | When using the SCM-based approach, you can customize waiting time in ms between attempts to push the stubs to git.
|`stubrunner.properties.git.ensure-git-suffix` | `true` | When using the SCM based approach, you can prevent stubrunner from adding `.git` to the repository URL by setting this property to `false`. This adds compatibility with git repositories which do not support such URLs, for example Azure DevOps.

|`stubrunner.properties.stubs.find-producer` | `false` | When using the `stubs` protocol, you can toggle this flag to search for contracts in the `group id / artifact id` instead of taking the stubs directly from the provided folder.
