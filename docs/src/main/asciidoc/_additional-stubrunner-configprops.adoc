IMPORTANT: The following properties can be passed as a system property (for example, `stubrunner.properties.git.branch`), as an environment variable (for example, `STUBRUNNER_PROPERTIES_GIT_BRANCH`), or as a property inside stub runner's annotation or a JUnit Rule (JUnit 4) or Extension (JUnit 5). In the latter case, you can pass the `git.branch` property instead of `stubrunner.properties.git.branch`.
