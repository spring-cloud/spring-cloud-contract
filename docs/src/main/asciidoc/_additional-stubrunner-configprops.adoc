IMPORTANT: The following properties can be passed as a system property (e.g. `stubrunner.properties.git.branch`) or via an environment variable (e.g. `STUBRUNNER_PROPERTIES_GIT_BRANCH`) or as a property inside stub runner's annotation or a JUnit Rule / Extension. In the latter case you can pass `git.branch` property name instead of the `stubrunner.properties.git.branch` one.

.Stubrunner Properties Options
|===
|Name | Default | Description

|stubrunner.properties.pactbroker.provider-name-with-group-id | false | When using the Pact Broker based approach, you can automatically group id to the provider name.

|stubrunner.properties.git.branch |  | When using the SCM based approach, you can customize the branch name to check out.
|stubrunner.properties.git.commit-message | Updating project [$project] with stubs | When using the SCM based approach, you can customize the commit message for created stubs. The `$project` text will be replaced with the project name.
|stubrunner.properties.git.no-of-attempts | 10 | When using the SCM based approach, you can customize number of retries to push the stubs to Git.
|stubrunner.properties.git.username |  | When using the SCM based approach, you can pass the username to connect to the Git repository.
|stubrunner.properties.git.password |  | When using the SCM based approach, you can pass the password to connect to the Git repository.
|stubrunner.properties.git.wait-between-attempts | 1000 | When using the SCM based approach, you can customize waiting time in ms between trying to push the stubs to Git.
|stubrunner.properties.git.ensure-git-suffix | true | When using the SCM based approach, you can prevent stubrunner from adding `.git` to the repository URL by setting this property to `false`. This adds compatibility with git repositories which do not support such URLs, for example Azure DevOps.

|stubrunner.properties.stubs.find-producer | false | When using the Stubs protocol, you can toggle this flag to search for contracts via the `group id / artifact id` instead of taking the stubs directly from the provided folder.
