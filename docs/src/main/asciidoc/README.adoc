= Spring Cloud Contract

What you always need it confidence in pushing new features into a new application or service in a distributed system. This project provides support for Consumer Driven Contracts and service schemas in Spring applications, covering a range of options for writing tests, publishing them as assets, asserting that a contract is kept by producers and consumers, for HTTP and message-based interactions.
