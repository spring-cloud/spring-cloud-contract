= Using the Stub Runner Boot Application

WARNING:: Due to the limitations in the current artifact repository release tool, we cannot currently release executable jars and as of `4.1.6` we're skipping the release of this artifact. Stub Runner Boot is still available through the xref:../docker-project.adoc#docker-stubrunner[Docker Stub Runner Boot image], which is the preferred way of using the app. You can also access https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/main/spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner-boot[the sources in the project repository] and build the app yourself. If the required adjustments are made in the artifact repository tooling, we'll resume publishing this jar.

Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner Boot is a Spring Boot application that exposes REST endpoints to
trigger the messaging labels and to access WireMock servers.

[[features-stub-runner-boot-security]]
== Stub Runner Boot Security

The Stub Runner Boot application is not secured by design - securing it would require to add security to all
stubs even if they don't actually require it. Since this is a testing utility - the server is **not intended**
to be used in production environments.

IMPORTANT: It is expected that **only a trusted client** has access to the Stub Runner Boot server. You should not
run this application as a Fat Jar or a xref:../docker-project.adoc[Docker Image] in untrusted locations.

[[features-stub-runner-boot-server]]
== Stub Runner Server

To use the Stub Runner Server, add the following dependency:

====
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
compile "org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-stub-runner"
----
====

Then annotate a class with `@EnableStubRunnerServer`, build a fat jar, and it is ready to work.

For the properties, see the xref:../project-features-stubrunner/stub-runner-junit.adoc#features-stub-runner-rule-spring[Stub Runner Spring] section.

[[features-stub-runner-boot-how-fat-jar]]
== Stub Runner Server Fat Jar

You can download a standalone JAR from Maven (for example, for version 2.0.1.RELEASE)
by running the following commands:

====
[source,bash,indent=0]
----
$ wget -O stub-runner.jar 'https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner-boot/2.0.1.RELEASE/spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner-boot-2.0.1.RELEASE.jar'
$ java -jar stub-runner.jar --spring.cloud.contract.stubrunner.ids=... --spring.cloud.contract.stubrunner.repositoryRoot=...
----
====

[[features-stub-runner-boot-how-cli]]
== Spring Cloud CLI

Starting from the `1.4.0.RELEASE` version of the https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-cli[Spring Cloud CLI]
project, you can start Stub Runner Boot by running `spring cloud stubrunner`.

To pass the configuration, you can create a `spring.cloud.contract.stubrunner.yml` file in the current working directory,
in a subdirectory called `config`, or in `~/.spring-cloud`. The file could resemble the following
example for running stubs installed locally:


.stubrunner.yml
====
[source,yml,indent=0]
----
spring.cloud.contract.stubrunner:
  stubsMode: LOCAL
  ids:
    - com.example:beer-api-producer:+:9876
----
====

Then you can call `spring cloud stubrunner` from your terminal window to start
the Stub Runner server. It is available at port `8750`.

[[features-stub-runner-boot-endpoints]]
== Endpoints

Stub Runner Boot offers two endpoints:

* xref:../project-features-stubrunner/stub-runner-boot.adoc#features-stub-runner-boot-endpoints-http[HTTP]
* xref:../project-features-stubrunner/stub-runner-boot.adoc#features-stub-runner-boot-endpoints-messaging[Messaging]

[[features-stub-runner-boot-endpoints-http]]
=== HTTP

For HTTP, Stub Runner Boot makes the following endpoints available:

- GET `/stubs`: Returns a list of all running stubs in `ivy:integer` notation
- GET `/stubs/\{ivy}`: Returns a port for the given `ivy` notation (when calling the endpoint `ivy` can also be `artifactId` only)

[[features-stub-runner-boot-endpoints-messaging]]
=== Messaging

For Messaging, Stub Runner Boot makes the following endpoints available:

- GET `/triggers`: Returns a list of all running labels in `ivy : [ label1, label2 ...]` notation
- POST `/triggers/\{label}`: Runs a trigger with `label`
- POST `/triggers/\{ivy}/\{label}`: Runs a trigger with a `label` for the given `ivy` notation
(when calling the endpoint, `ivy` can also be `artifactId` only)

[[features-stub-runner-boot-endpoints-example]]
== Example

The following example shows typical usage of Stub Runner Boot:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{stubrunner_core_path}/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/server/StubRunnerBootSpec.groovy[tags=boot_usage]

[[features-stub-runner-boot-service-discovery]]
== Stub Runner Boot with Service Discovery

One way to use Stub Runner Boot is to use it as a feed of stubs for "`smoke tests`". What does that mean?
Assume that you do not want to deploy 50 microservices to a test environment in order
to see whether your application works. You have already run a suite of tests during the build process,
but you would also like to ensure that the packaging of your application works. You can
deploy your application to an environment, start it, and run a couple of tests on it to see whether
it works. We can call those tests "`smoke tests`", because their purpose is to check only a handful
of testing scenarios.

The problem with this approach is that, if you use microservices, you most likely also
use a service discovery tool. Stub Runner Boot lets you solve this issue by starting the
required stubs and registering them in a service discovery tool.

Now assume that we want to start this application so that the stubs get automatically registered.
We can do so by running the application with `java -jar $\{SYSTEM_PROPS} stub-runner-boot-eureka-example.jar`, where
`$\{SYSTEM_PROPS}`.

That way, your deployed application can send requests to started WireMock servers through service
discovery. Most likely, points 1 through 3 could be set by default in `application.yml`, because they are not
likely to change. That way, you can provide only the list of stubs to download whenever you start
the Stub Runner Boot.
