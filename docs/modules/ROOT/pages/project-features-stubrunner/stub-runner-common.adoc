== Common Properties for JUnit and Spring

You can set repetitive properties by using system properties or Spring configuration
properties. The following table shows their names with their default values:

[frame="topbot",options="header"]
|===============
| Property name | Default value | Description
|`spring.cloud.contract.stubrunner.minPort`|`10000`| Minimum value of a port for a started WireMock with stubs.
|`spring.cloud.contract.stubrunner.maxPort`|`15000`| Maximum value of a port for a started WireMock with stubs.
|`spring.cloud.contract.stubrunner.repositoryRoot`|| Maven repository URL. If blank, then call the local Maven repo.
|`spring.cloud.contract.stubrunner.classifier`|`stubs`| Default classifier for the stub artifacts.
|`spring.cloud.contract.stubrunner.stubsMode`|`CLASSPATH`| The way you want to fetch and register the stubs.
|`spring.cloud.contract.stubrunner.ids`|| Array of Ivy notation stubs to download.
|`spring.cloud.contract.stubrunner.username`|| Optional username to access the tool that stores the JARs with
stubs.
|`spring.cloud.contract.stubrunner.password`|| Optional password to access the tool that stores the JARs with
stubs.
|`spring.cloud.contract.stubrunner.stubsPerConsumer`|`false`| Set to `true` if you want to use different stubs for
each consumer instead of registering all stubs for every consumer.
|`spring.cloud.contract.stubrunner.consumerName`|| If you want to use a stub for each consumer and want to
override the consumer name, change this value.
|===============

[[features-stub-runner-stub-runner-stub-ids]]
== Stub Runner Stubs IDs

You can set the stubs to download in the `spring.cloud.contract.stubrunner.ids` system property. They
use the following pattern:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
groupId:artifactId:version:classifier:port
----
====

Note that `version`, `classifier`, and `port` are optional.

* If you do not provide the `port`, a random one is picked.
* If you do not provide the `classifier`, the default is used. (Note that you can
pass an empty classifier this way: `groupId:artifactId:version:`).
* If you do not provide the `version`, then `+` is passed, and the latest one is
downloaded.

`port` means the port of the WireMock server.

IMPORTANT: Starting with version 1.0.4, you can provide a range of versions that you
would like the Stub Runner to take into consideration. You can read more about the
Aether versioning ranges
https://wiki.eclipse.org/Aether/New_and_Noteworthy#Version_Ranges[here].
