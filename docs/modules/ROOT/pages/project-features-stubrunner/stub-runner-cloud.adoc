include::partial$_attributes.adoc[]

Stub Runner can integrate with Spring Cloud.

For real life examples, see:

- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/spring-cloud-contract-samples/tree/{samples_branch}/producer[The producer application sample]
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/spring-cloud-contract-samples/tree/{samples_branch}/consumer_with_discovery[The consumer application sample]

[[features-stub-runner-cloud-stubbing-discovery]]
== Stubbing Service Discovery

The most important feature of `Stub Runner Spring Cloud` is the fact that it stubs:

- `DiscoveryClient`
- `ReactorServiceInstanceLoadBalancer`

That means that, regardless of whether you use Zookeeper, Consul, Eureka, or anything
else, you do not need that in your tests. We are starting WireMock instances of your
dependencies and we are telling your application, whenever you use `Feign`, to load a
balanced `RestTemplate` or `DiscoveryClient` directly, to call those stubbed servers
instead of calling the real Service Discovery tool.

[[features-stub-runner-cloud-stubbing-profiles]]
=== Test Profiles and Service Discovery

In your integration tests, you typically do not want to call either a discovery service (such as Eureka)
or Config Server. That is why you create an additional test configuration in which you want to disable
these features.

Due to certain limitations of https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-commons/issues/156[`spring-cloud-commons`],
to achieve this, you have to disable these properties
in a static block such as the following example (for Eureka):

====
[source,java]
----
    //Hack to work around https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-commons/issues/156
    static {
        System.setProperty("eureka.client.enabled", "false");
        System.setProperty("spring.cloud.config.failFast", "false");
    }
----
====

[[features-stub-runner-additional-config]]
== Additional Configuration

You can match the `artifactId` of the stub with the name of your application by using the `spring.cloud.contract.stubrunner.idsToServiceIds:` map.

TIP: By default, all service discovery is stubbed. This means that, regardless of whether you have
an existing `DiscoveryClient`, its results are ignored. However, if you want to reuse it, you can set
 `spring.cloud.contract.stubrunner.cloud.delegate.enabled` to `true`, and then your existing `DiscoveryClient` results are
 merged with the stubbed ones.

The default Maven configuration used by Stub Runner can be tweaked either
by setting the following system properties or by setting the corresponding environment variables:

- `maven.repo.local`: Path to the custom maven local repository location
- `org.apache.maven.user-settings`: Path to custom maven user settings location
- `org.apache.maven.global-settings`: Path to maven global settings location
