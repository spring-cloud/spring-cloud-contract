In this section, we show how to customize the way you work with https://wiremock.org[WireMock].

[[customization-wiremock-extension]]
== Registering Your Own WireMock Extension

WireMock lets you register custom extensions. By default, Spring Cloud Contract registers
the transformer, which lets you reference a request from a response. If you want to
provide your own extensions, you can register an implementation of the
`org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.dsl.wiremock.WireMockExtensions` interface.
Since we use the `spring.factories` extension approach, you can create an entry similar to
the following in the `META-INF/spring.factories` file:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{stubrunner_core_path}/src/test/resources/META-INF/spring.factories[indent=0]
----

The following example shows a custom extension:

.TestWireMockExtensions.groovy
[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{verifier_root_path}/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/dsl/wiremock/TestWireMockExtensions.groovy[indent=0]
----

IMPORTANT: If you want the transformation to be applied only for a mapping that explicitly
requires it, override the `applyGlobally()` method and set it to `false` .

[[customization-wiremock-from-metadata]]
== Customization of WireMock via Metadata

With version 3.0.0 you're able to set `metadata` in your contracts. If you set an entry with key equal to `wiremock` and the value
will be a valid WireMock's `StubMapping` JSON / map or an actual `StubMapping` object, Spring Cloud Contract will patch the generated
stub with part of your customization. Let's look at the following example

{samples_code}/standalone/dsl/http-server/src/test/resources/contracts/yml/fraud/shouldReturnFraudStats.yml[Click here to see the code]

In the `metadata` section we've set an entry with key `wiremock` and its value is a JSON `StubMapping` that sets a delay in the generated stub. Such code allowed us to get the following merged WireMock JSON stub.

[source,json,indent=0]
----
{
  "id" : "ebae49e2-a2a3-490c-a57f-ba28e26b81ea",
  "request" : {
    "url" : "/yamlfrauds",
    "method" : "GET"
  },
  "response" : {
    "status" : 200,
    "body" : "{\"count\":200}",
    "headers" : {
      "Content-Type" : "application/json"
    },
    "fixedDelayMilliseconds" : 2000,
    "transformers" : [ "response-template" ]
  },
  "uuid" : "ebae49e2-a2a3-490c-a57f-ba28e26b81ea"
}
----

The current implementation allows to manipulate only the stub side (we don't change the generated test). Also, what does not get changed
are the whole request and body and headers of the response.

[[customization-wiremock-from-metadata-custom-processor]]
== Customization of WireMock via Metadata and a Custom Processor

If you want to apply a custom WireMock `StubMapping` post processing, you can under `META-INF/spring.factories` under the
`org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.converter.StubProcessor` key register your own implementation of a stub processor. For your convenience we've created an interface called `org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.wiremock.WireMockStubPostProcessor` that is dedicated to WireMock.

You'll have to implement methods to inform Spring Cloud Contract whether the post processor is applicable for a given contract and how should the post processing look like.

IMPORTANT: On the consumer side, when using Stub Runner, remember to pass the custom `HttpServerStubConfigurer` implementation (e.g. the one that extends `WireMockHttpServerStubConfigurer`) where you'll register a custom extension of your choosing. If you don't do so, even you have a custom WireMock extension on the classpath, WireMock will not notice it, won't apply it and will print out a warning statement that the given extension was not found.
