= Consumer-Driven Contracts: Stubs Per Consumer

There are cases in which two consumers of the same endpoint want to have two different responses.

TIP: This approach also lets you immediately know which consumer uses which part of your API.
You can remove part of a response that your API produces and see which of your autogenerated tests
fails. If none fails, you can safely delete that part of the response, because nobody uses it.

Consider the following example of a contract defined for the producer called `producer`,
which has two consumers (`foo-consumer` and `bar-consumer`):

====
.Consumer `foo-service`
[source,groovy]
----
request {
   url '/foo'
   method GET()
}
response {
    status OK()
    body(
       foo: "foo"
    }
}
----

.Consumer `bar-service`
[source,groovy]
----
request {
   url '/bar'
   method GET()
}
response {
    status OK()
    body(
       bar: "bar"
    }
}
----
====

You cannot produce two different responses for the same request. That is why you can properly package the
contracts and then profit from the `stubsPerConsumer` feature.

On the producer side, the consumers can have a folder that contains contracts related only to them.
By setting the `stubrunner.stubs-per-consumer` flag to `true`, we no longer register all stubs but only those that
correspond to the consumer application's name. In other words, we scan the path of every stub and,
if it contains a subfolder with name of the consumer in the path, only then is it registered.

On the `foo` producer side the contracts would look like this

[source,bash]
----
.
└── contracts
    ├── bar-consumer
    │   ├── bookReturnedForBar.groovy
    │   └── shouldCallBar.groovy
    └── foo-consumer
        ├── bookReturnedForFoo.groovy
        └── shouldCallFoo.groovy
----

The `bar-consumer` consumer can either set the `spring.application.name` or the `stubrunner.consumer-name` to `bar-consumer`
Alternatively, you can set the test as follows:

====
[source,groovy]
----
include:../:{stubrunner_core_path}/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/spring/cloud/StubRunnerStubsPerConsumerSpec.groovy[tags=test]
...
}
----
====

Then only the stubs registered under a path that contains `bar-consumer` in its name (that is, those from the
`src/test/resources/contracts/bar-consumer/some/contracts/...` folder) are allowed to be referenced.

You can also set the consumer name explicitly, as follows:

====
[source,groovy]
----
include:../:{stubrunner_core_path}/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/spring/cloud/StubRunnerStubsPerConsumerWithConsumerNameSpec.groovy[tags=test]
...
}
----
====

Then only the stubs registered under a path that contains the `foo-consumer` in its name (that is, those from the
`src/test/resources/contracts/foo-consumer/some/contracts/...` folder) are allowed to be referenced.
