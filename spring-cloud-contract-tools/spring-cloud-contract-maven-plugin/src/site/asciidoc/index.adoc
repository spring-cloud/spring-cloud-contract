= Spring Cloud Contract Maven Plugin

Just to make long story short - Spring Cloud Contract Verifier is a tool that enables Consumer Driven Contract (CDC) development of JVM-based applications.

 * Stubs mappings to be used by WireMock when doing integration testing on the client code (client tests).

 * Acceptance tests used to verify if server-side implementation of the API is compliant with the contract (server tests).

Spring Cloud Contract Verifier moves TDD to the level of software architecture.

This plugin allows you to:

- generate tests from the provided contracts
- run the stubs from the stubs
