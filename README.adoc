== Spring Cloud Contract

You always need confidence when pushing new features into a new application or service in
a distributed system. To that end, this project provides support for consumer-driven
contracts and service schemas in Spring applications, covering a range of options for
writing tests, publishing them as assets, and asserting that a contract is kept by
producers and consumers -- for both HTTP and message-based interactions.

=== Spring Cloud Contract workshops

If you prefer to learn about the project by doing some tutorials, you can check out the
workshops under
https://cloud-samples.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract-samples/workshops.html[this link].

== Project page

You can read more about Spring Cloud Contract by going to https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-contract[the project page]

== Contributing

:spring-cloud-build-branch: master

Spring Cloud is released under the non-restrictive Apache 2.0 license,
and follows a very standard Github development process, using Github
tracker for issues and merging pull requests into master. If you want
to contribute even something trivial please do not hesitate, but
follow the guidelines below.

=== Sign the Contributor License Agreement
Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the
https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[Contributor License Agreement].
Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main
repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an
author credit if we do.  Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and
given the ability to merge pull requests.

=== Code of Conduct
This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/code-of-conduct.adoc[code of
conduct]. By participating, you  are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

=== Code Conventions and Housekeeping
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* Use the Spring Framework code format conventions. If you use Eclipse
  you can import formatter settings using the
  `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file from the
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/spring-cloud-dependencies-parent/eclipse-code-formatter.xml[Spring
  Cloud Build] project. If using IntelliJ, you can use the
  https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546[Eclipse Code Formatter
  Plugin] to import the same file.
* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an
  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is
  for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files
  in the project)
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more
  than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or
  other target branch in the main project).
* When writing a commit message please follow https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions],
  if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit
  message (where XXXX is the issue number).

=== Checkstyle

Spring Cloud Build comes with a set of checkstyle rules. You can find them in the `spring-cloud-build-tools` module. The most notable files under the module are:

.spring-cloud-build-tools/
----
└── src
    ├── checkstyle
    │   └── checkstyle-suppressions.xml <3>
    └── main
        └── resources
            ├── checkstyle-header.txt <2>
            └── checkstyle.xml <1>
----
<1> Default Checkstyle rules
<2> File header setup
<3> Default suppression rules

==== Checkstyle configuration

Checkstyle rules are *disabled by default*. To add checkstyle to your project just define the following properties and plugins.

.pom.xml
----
<properties>
<maven-checkstyle-plugin.failsOnError>true</maven-checkstyle-plugin.failsOnError> <1>
        <maven-checkstyle-plugin.failsOnViolation>true
        </maven-checkstyle-plugin.failsOnViolation> <2>
        <maven-checkstyle-plugin.includeTestSourceDirectory>true
        </maven-checkstyle-plugin.includeTestSourceDirectory> <3>
</properties>

<build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin> <4>
                <groupId>io.spring.javaformat</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-javaformat-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            </plugin>
            <plugin> <5>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-checkstyle-plugin</artifactId>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>

    <reporting>
        <plugins>
            <plugin> <5>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-checkstyle-plugin</artifactId>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </reporting>
</build>
----
<1> Fails the build upon Checkstyle errors
<2> Fails the build upon Checkstyle violations
<3> Checkstyle analyzes also the test sources
<4> Add the Spring Java Format plugin that will reformat your code to pass most of the Checkstyle formatting rules
<5> Add checkstyle plugin to your build and reporting phases

If you need to suppress some rules (e.g. line length needs to be longer), then it's enough for you to define a file under `${project.root}/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppressions.xml` with your suppressions. Example:

.projectRoot/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppresions.xml
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE suppressions PUBLIC
		"-//Puppy Crawl//DTD Suppressions 1.1//EN"
		"https://www.puppycrawl.com/dtds/suppressions_1_1.dtd">
<suppressions>
	<suppress files=".*ConfigServerApplication\.java" checks="HideUtilityClassConstructor"/>
	<suppress files=".*ConfigClientWatch\.java" checks="LineLengthCheck"/>
</suppressions>
----

It's advisable to copy the `${spring-cloud-build.rootFolder}/.editorconfig` and `${spring-cloud-build.rootFolder}/.springformat` to your project. That way, some default formatting rules will be applied. You can do so by running this script:

```bash
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/.editorconfig -o .editorconfig
$ touch .springformat
```

=== IDE setup

==== Intellij IDEA

In order to setup Intellij you should import our coding conventions, inspection profiles and set up the checkstyle plugin.
The following files can be found in the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/tree/master/spring-cloud-build-tools[Spring Cloud Build] project.

.spring-cloud-build-tools/
----
└── src
    ├── checkstyle
    │   └── checkstyle-suppressions.xml <3>
    └── main
        └── resources
            ├── checkstyle-header.txt <2>
            ├── checkstyle.xml <1>
            └── intellij
                ├── Intellij_Project_Defaults.xml <4>
                └── Intellij_Spring_Boot_Java_Conventions.xml <5>
----
<1> Default Checkstyle rules
<2> File header setup
<3> Default suppression rules
<4> Project defaults for Intellij that apply most of Checkstyle rules
<5> Project style conventions for Intellij that apply most of Checkstyle rules

.Code style

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/{spring-cloud-build-branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/intellij-code-style.png[Code style]

Go to `File` -> `Settings` -> `Editor` -> `Code style`. There click on the icon next to the `Scheme` section. There, click on the `Import Scheme` value and pick the `Intellij IDEA code style XML` option. Import the `spring-cloud-build-tools/src/main/resources/intellij/Intellij_Spring_Boot_Java_Conventions.xml` file.

.Inspection profiles

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/{spring-cloud-build-branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/intellij-inspections.png[Code style]

Go to `File` -> `Settings` -> `Editor` -> `Inspections`. There click on the icon next to the `Profile` section. There, click on the `Import Profile` and import the `spring-cloud-build-tools/src/main/resources/intellij/Intellij_Project_Defaults.xml` file.

.Checkstyle

To have Intellij work with Checkstyle, you have to install the `Checkstyle` plugin. It's advisable to also install the `Assertions2Assertj` to automatically convert the JUnit assertions

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/{spring-cloud-build-branch}/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/intellij-checkstyle.png[Checkstyle]

Go to `File` -> `Settings` -> `Other settings` -> `Checkstyle`. There click on the `+` icon in the `Configuration file` section. There, you'll have to define where the checkstyle rules should be picked from. In the image above, we've picked the rules from the cloned Spring Cloud Build repository. However, you can point to the Spring Cloud Build's GitHub repository (e.g. for the `checkstyle.xml` : `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/spring-cloud-build-tools/src/main/resources/checkstyle.xml`). We need to provide the following variables:

- `checkstyle.header.file` - please point it to the Spring Cloud Build's, `spring-cloud-build-tools/src/main/resources/checkstyle-header.txt` file either in your cloned repo or via the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/spring-cloud-build-tools/src/main/resources/checkstyle-header.txt` URL.
- `checkstyle.suppressions.file` - default suppressions. Please point it to the Spring Cloud Build's, `spring-cloud-build-tools/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppressions.xml` file either in your cloned repo or via the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/spring-cloud-build-tools/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppressions.xml` URL.
- `checkstyle.additional.suppressions.file` - this variable corresponds to suppressions in your local project. E.g. you're working on `spring-cloud-contract`. Then point to the `project-root/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppressions.xml` folder. Example for `spring-cloud-contract` would be: `/home/username/spring-cloud-contract/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-suppressions.xml`.

IMPORTANT: Remember to set the `Scan Scope` to `All sources` since we apply checkstyle rules for production and test sources.

== How to Build Spring Cloud Contract

=== Cloning the repository on Windows

While cloning this project on Windows, some files in the git repository may exceed the Windows maximum file path limit of 255 characters, which may
result in an incorrectly (probably partially) checked out repository.

To resolve this issue, you can set the `core.longPaths` attribute to `true` or clone the Spring Cloud Contract repository.

To set the `core.longPaths` attribute to `true`, you have three options:

- Change it for all users of the machine (doing so requires administrator privileges):


[source,bash]
----
git config --system core.longPaths true
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract.git
----

- Change it for the current user (no administrative privileges required):

[source,bash]
----
git config --global core.longPaths true
git clone https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract.git
----

- Change for just this repository (administrative privileges depend on where the repository is being cloned to):

[source,bash]
----
git clone -c core.longPaths=true https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract.git
----

IMPORTANT: You need to have all the necessary Groovy plugins
installed for your IDE to properly resolve the sources. For example, in
Intellij IDEA, having both the Eclipse Groovy Compiler Plugin and the GMavenPlus Intellij
Plugin results in properly imported project.

IMPORTANT: Spring Cloud Contract builds Docker images. Remember to
have Docker installed.

IMPORTANT: If you want to run the build in offline mode, you must have Maven 3.5.2+ installed.

=== Project structure

The following listing shows the Spring Cloud Contract folder structure:

```
├── config
├── docker
├── samples
├── scripts
├── specs
├── spring-cloud-contract-dependencies
├── spring-cloud-contract-shade
├── spring-cloud-contract-starters
├── spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner
├── spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner-boot
├── spring-cloud-contract-tools
├── spring-cloud-contract-verifier
├── spring-cloud-contract-wiremock
└── tests
```

The following list describes each of the top-level folders in the project structure:

- `config`: Folder contains setup for Spring Cloud Release Tools automated release process
- `docker`: Folder contains docker images
- `samples`: Folder contains test samples together with standalone ones used also to build documentation
- `scripts`: Contains scripts to build and test `Spring Cloud Contract` with Maven, Gradle and standalone projects
- `specs`: Contains specifications for the Contract DSL.
- `spring-cloud-contract-dependencies`: Contains Spring Cloud Contract BOM
- `spring-cloud-contract-shade`: Shaded dependencies used by the plugins
- `spring-cloud-contract-starters`: Contains Spring Cloud Contract Starters
- `spring-cloud-contract-spec`: Contains specification modules (contains concept of a Contract)
- `spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner`: Contains Stub Runner related modules
- `spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner-boot`: Contains Stub Runner Boot app
- `spring-cloud-contract-tools`: Gradle and Maven plugin for `Spring Cloud Contract Verifier`
- `spring-cloud-contract-verifier`: Core of the `Spring Cloud Contract Verifier` functionality
- `spring-cloud-contract-wiremock`: All WireMock related functionality
- `tests`: Integration tests for different messaging technologies

=== Commands

To build the core functionality together with the Maven Plugin, you can run the following
command:

```
./mvnw clean install -P integration
```

Calling that function builds the core, the Maven plugin, and the Gradle plugin and runs
end-to_end tests on the
standalone samples in the proper order (both for Maven and Gradle).

To build only the Gradle Plugin, you can run the following commands:

```
cd spring-cloud-contract-tools/spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin
./gradlew clean build
```

=== Helpful scripts

We provide a couple of helpful scripts to build the project.

To build the project in parallel (by default, it uses four cores, but you can change it),
run the following command:

```
./scripts/parallelBuild.sh
```

To use eight 8 cores, run the following command:

```
CORES=8 ./scripts/parallelBuild.sh
```

To build the project without any integration tests (by default, this uses one core), run
the following command:

```
./scripts/noIntegration.sh
```

To use eight cores, run the following command:

```
CORES=8 ./scripts/noIntegration.sh
```

To generate the documentation (for both the root project and the maven plugin), run the
following command:

```
./scripts/generateDocs.sh
```
