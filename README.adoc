== Spring Cloud Contract

What you always need it confidence in pushing new features into a new application or service in a distributed system.
This project provides support for Consumer Driven Contracts and service schemas in Spring applications, covering a
range of options for writing tests, publishing them as assets, asserting that a contract is kept by producers
and consumers, for HTTP and message-based interactions.

=== Spring Cloud Contract WireMock

:core_path: ../../../..
:doc_samples: {core_path}/samples/wiremock-jetty

Modules giving you the possibility to use
http://wiremock.org[WireMock] with different servers by using the
"ambient" server embedded in a Spring Boot application. Check out the
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/master/samples[samples]
for more details.

If you have a Spring Boot application that uses Tomcat as an embedded
server, for example (the default with `spring-boot-starter-web`), then
you can simply add `spring-cloud-contract-wiremock` to your classpath
and add `@AutoConfigureWireMock` in order to be able to use Wiremock
in your tests. Wiremock runs as a stub server and you can register
stub behaviour using a Java API or via static JSON declarations as
part of your test. Here's a simple example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@AutoConfigureWireMock(port = 0)
public class WiremockForDocsTests {
	// A service that calls out over HTTP
	@Autowired private Service service;

	// Using the WireMock APIs in the normal way:
	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		// Stubbing WireMock
		stubFor(get(urlEqualTo("/resource"))
				.willReturn(aResponse().withHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain").withBody("Hello World!")));
		// We're asserting if WireMock responded properly
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World!");
	}

}
----

To start the stub server on a different port use `@AutoConfigureWireMock(port=9999)` (for example), and for a random port use the value 0. The stub server port will be bindable in the test application context as "wiremock.server.port". Using `@AutoConfigureWireMock` adds a bean of type `WiremockConfiguration` to your test application context, where it will be cached in between methods and classes having the same context, just like for normal Spring integration tests.

=== Registering Stubs Automatically

If you add a `stubs` attribute to your `@AutoConfigureWireMock` then
it will register WireMock JSON stubs from the file system or
classpath. The stubs attribute can be a resource pattern (ant-style)
or a directory, in which case `**/*.json` is appended. Example:

----
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureWireMock(stubs="classpath:/stubs")
public class WiremockImportApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private Service service;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World!");
	}

}
----

=== Alternative: Using JUnit Rules

For a more conventional WireMock experience, using JUnit `@Rules` to
start and stop the server, just use the `WireMockSpring` convenience
class to obtain an `Options` instance:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@AutoConfigureWireMock
public class WiremockForDocsClassRuleTests {

	// Start WireMock on some dynamic port
	@ClassRule
	public static WireMockClassRule wiremock = new WireMockClassRule(
			WireMockSpring.options().dynamicPort());
	// A service that calls out over HTTP to localhost:${wiremock.port}
	@Autowired
	private Service service;

	// Using the WireMock APIs in the normal way:
	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		// Stubbing WireMock
		wiremock.stubFor(get(urlEqualTo("/resource"))
				.willReturn(aResponse().withHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain").withBody("Hello World!")));
		// We're asserting if WireMock responded properly
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World!");
	}

}
----

The use `@ClassRule` means that the server will shut down after all the methods in this class.

== WireMock and Spring MVC Mocks

Spring Cloud Contract provides a convenience class that can load JSON WireMock stubs into a
Spring `MockRestServiceServer`. Here's an example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.NONE)
public class WiremockForDocsMockServerApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private RestTemplate restTemplate;

	@Autowired
	private Service service;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		// will read stubs classpath
		MockRestServiceServer server = WireMockRestServiceServer.with(this.restTemplate)
				.baseUrl("http://example.org").stubs("classpath:/stubs/resource.json")
				.build();
		// We're asserting if WireMock responded properly
		assertThat(this.service.go()).isEqualTo("Hello World");
		server.verify();
	}
}
----

The `baseUrl` is prepended to all mock calls, and the `stubs()`
method takes a stub path resource pattern as an argument. So in this
example the stub defined at `/stubs/resource.json` is loaded into the
mock server, so if the `RestTemplate` is asked to visit
`http://example.org/` it will get the responses as declared
there. More than one stub pattern can be specified, and each one can
be a directory (for a recursive list of all ".json"), or a fixed
filename (like in the example above) or an ant-style pattern. The JSON
format is the normal WireMock format which you can read about in the
WireMock website.

Currently we support Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow as Spring Boot
embedded servers, and Wiremock itself has "native" support for a
particular version of Jetty (currently 9.2). To use the native Jetty
you need to add the native wiremock dependencies and exclude the
Spring Boot container if there is one.

== Generating Stubs using RestDocs

https://projects.spring.io/spring-restdocs[Spring RestDocs] can be
used to generate documentation (e.g. in asciidoctor format) for an
HTTP API with Spring MockMvc or RestEasy. At the same time as you
generate documentation for your API, you can also generate WireMock
stubs, by using Spring Cloud Contract WireMock. Just write your normal
RestDocs test cases and use `@AutoConfigureRestDocs` to have stubs
automatically in the restdocs output directory. For example:


[source,java,indent=0]
----
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureRestDocs(outputDir = "target/snippets")
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
public class ApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private MockMvc mockMvc;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		mockMvc.perform(get("/resource"))
				.andExpect(content().string("Hello World"))
				.andDo(document("resource"));
	}
}
----

From this test will be generated a WireMock stub at
"target/snippets/stubs/resource.json". It matches all GET requests to
the "/resource" path.

Without any additional configuration this will create a stub with a
request matcher for the HTTP method and all headers except "host" and
"content-length". To match the request more precisely, for example to
match the body of a POST or PUT, we need to explicitly create a
request matcher. This will do two things: 1) create a stub that only
matches the way you specify, 2) assert that the request in the test
case also matches the same conditions.

The main entry point for this is `WireMockRestDocs.verify()` which can
be used as a substitute for the `document()` convenience method. For
example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureRestDocs(outputDir = "target/snippets")
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
public class ApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	private MockMvc mockMvc;

	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		mockMvc.perform(post("/resource")
                .content("{\"id\":\"123456\",\"message\":\"Hello World\"}"))
				.andExpect(status.isOk())
				.andDo(verify().jsonPath("$.id")
                        .stub("resource"));
	}
}
----

So this contract is saying: any valid POST with an "id" field will get
back an the same response as in this test. You can chain together
calls to `.jsonPath()` to add additional matchers. The
https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath[JayWay documentation] can help you
to get up to speed with JSON Path if it is unfamiliar to you.

Instead of the `jsonPath` and `contentType` convenience methods, you
can also use the WireMock APIs to verify the request matches the
created stub. Example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	@Test
	public void contextLoads() throws Exception {
		mockMvc.perform(post("/resource")
                .content("{\"id\":\"123456\",\"message\":\"Hello World\"}"))
				.andExpect(status.isOk())
				.andDo(verify()
						.wiremock(WireMock.post(
							urlPathEquals("/resource"))
							.withRequestBody(matchingJsonPath("$.id"))
                        .stub("post-resource"));
	}
----

The WireMock API is rich - you can match headers, query parameters,
and request body by regex as well as by json path - so this can useful
to create stubs with a wider range of parameters. The above example
will generate a stub something like this:

.post-resource.json
[source,json]
----
{
  "request" : {
    "url" : "/resource",
    "method" : "POST",
    "bodyPatterns" : [ {
      "matchesJsonPath" : "$.id"
    }]
  },
  "response" : {
    "status" : 200,
    "body" : "Hello World",
    "headers" : {
      "X-Application-Context" : "application:-1",
      "Content-Type" : "text/plain"
    }
  }
}
----

NOTE: You can use either the `wiremock()` method or the `jsonPath()`
and `contentType()` methods to create request matchers, but not both.

On the consumer side, assuming the `resource.json` generated above is
available on the classpath, you can create a stub using WireMock in a
number of different ways, including as described above using
`@AutoConfigureWireMock(stubs="classpath:resource.json")`.

=== Spring Cloud Contract Verifier

:introduction_url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/master

=== Introduction

IMPORTANT: http://codearte.github.io/accurest[The documentation to the deprecated Accurest project in version 1.1.0 is available here.]

TIP: The Accurest project was initially started by Marcin Grzejszczak and Jakub Kubrynski (http://codearte.io[codearte.io])

Just to make long story short - Spring Cloud Contract Verifier is a tool that enables Consumer Driven Contract (CDC) development of JVM-based applications. It is shipped
with __Contract Definition Language__ (DSL). Contract definitions are used to produce following resources:

* JSON stub definitions to be used by WireMock when doing integration testing on the client code (__client tests__).
Test code must still be written by hand, test data is produced by Spring Cloud Contract Verifier.
* Messaging routes if you're using one. We're integrating with Spring Integration, Spring Cloud Stream and Apache Camel. You can however set your own integrations if you want to
* Acceptance tests (in JUnit or Spock) used to verify if server-side implementation of the API is compliant with the contract (__server tests__).
Full test is generated by Spring Cloud Contract Verifier.

Spring Cloud Contract Verifier moves TDD to the level of software architecture.

==== Why?

Let us assume that we have a system comprising of multiple microservices:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/Deps.png[Microservices Architecture]

===== Testing issues

If we wanted to test the application in top left corner if it can communicate with other services then we could do one of two things:

- deploy all microservices and perform end to end tests
- mock other microservices in unit / integration tests

Both have their advantages but also a lot of disadvantages. Let's focus on the latter.

*Deploy all microservices and perform end to end tests*

Advantages:

- simulates production
- tests real communication between services

Disadvantages:

- to test one microservice we would have to deploy 6 microservices, a couple of databases etc.
- the environment where the tests would be conducted would be locked for a single suite of tests (i.e. nobody else would be able to run the tests in the meantime).
- long to run
- very late feedback
- extremely hard to debug

*Mock other microservices in unit / integration tests*

Advantages:

- very fast feedback
- no infrastructure requirements

Disadvantages:

- the implementor of the service creates stubs thus they might have nothing to do with the reality
- you can go to production with passing tests and failing production

To solve the aforementioned issues Spring Cloud Contract Verifier with Stub Runner were created. Their main idea is to give you very fast feedback, without the need
to set up the whole world of microservices.

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/Stubs1.png[Stubbed Services]

If you work on stubs then the only applications you need are those that your application is using directly.

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/images/Stubs2.png[Stubbed Services]

Spring Cloud Contract Verifier gives you the certainty that the stubs that you're using were created by the service that you're calling. Also if you can use them it means that they were
tested against the producer's side. In other words - you can trust those stubs.

==== Purposes

The main purposes of Spring Cloud Contract Verifier with Stub Runner are:

  - to ensure that WireMock / Messaging stubs (used when developing the client) are doing exactly what actual server-side implementation will do,
  - to promote ATDD method and Microservices architectural style,
  - to provide a way to publish changes in contracts that are immediately visible on both sides,
  - to generate boilerplate test code used on the server side.

IMPORTANT: Spring Cloud Contract Verifier's purpose is NOT to start writing business features in the contracts.
Let's assume that we have a business use case of fraud check. If a user can be a fraud for 100 different reasons,
we would assume that you would create 2 contracts. One for the positive and one for the negative fraud case.
Contract tests are used to test contracts between applications and not to simulate full behaviour.

==== Client Side

During the tests you want to have a WireMock instance / Messaging route up and running that simulates the service Y.
You would like to feed that instance with a proper stub definition. That stub definition would need
to be valid and should also be reusable on the server side.

__Summing it up:__ On this side, in the stub definition, you can use patterns for request stubbing and you need exact
values for responses.

==== Server Side

Being a service Y since you are developing your stub, you need to be sure that it's actually resembling your
concrete implementation. You can't have a situation where your stub acts in one way and your application on
production behaves in a different way.

That's why from the provided stub acceptance tests will be generated that will ensure
that your application behaves in the same way as you define in your stub.

__Summing it up:__ On this side, in the stub definition, you need exact values as request and can use patterns/methods
for response verification.

==== Step by step guide to CDC

Let's take an example of Fraud Detection and Loan Issuance process. The business scenario is such that we want to issue loans to people but don't want them to steal the money from us. The current implementation of our system grants loans to everybody.

Let's assume that the `Loan Issuance` is a client to the
`Fraud Detection` server. In the current sprint we are required to develop a new feature - if a client wants to borrow too much money then we mark him as fraud.

Technical remark - Fraud Detection will have artifact id `http-server`, Loan Issuance `http-client` and both have group id `com.example`.

Social remark - both client and server development teams need to communicate directly and discuss changes while
going through the process. CDC is all about communication.

The https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/master/samples/standalone/dsl/http-server[server side code is available here] and https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/master/samples/standalone/dsl/http-client[the client side code here].

TIP: In this case the ownership of the contracts lays on the producer side. It means that physically
all the contract are present in the producer's repository

===== Consumer side (Loan Issuance)

As a developer of the Loan Issuance service (a consumer of the Fraud Detection server):

*start doing TDD by writing a test to your feature*

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
@Test
public void shouldBeRejectedDueToAbnormalLoanAmount() {
    // given:
    LoanApplication application = new LoanApplication(new Client("1234567890"),
            99999);
    // when:
    LoanApplicationResult loanApplication = service.loanApplication(application);
    // then:
    assertThat(loanApplication.getLoanApplicationStatus())
            .isEqualTo(LoanApplicationStatus.LOAN_APPLICATION_REJECTED);
    assertThat(loanApplication.getRejectionReason()).isEqualTo("Amount too high");
}
----

We've just written a test of our new feature. If a loan application for a big amount is received we should reject that loan application with some description.

*write the missing implementation*

At some point in time you need to send a request to the Fraud Detection service. Let's assume that we'd like to send the request containing the id of the client and the amount he wants to borrow from us. We'd like to send it to the `/fraudcheck` url via the `PUT` method.

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
ResponseEntity<FraudServiceResponse> response =
        restTemplate.exchange("http://localhost:" + port + "/fraudcheck", HttpMethod.PUT,
                new HttpEntity<>(request, httpHeaders),
                FraudServiceResponse.class);
----

For simplicity we've hardcoded the port of the Fraud Detection service at `8080` and our application is running on `8090`.

If we'd start the written test it would obviously break since we have no service running on port `8080`.

*clone the Fraud Detection service repository locally*

We'll start playing around with the server side contract. That's why we need to first clone it.

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
git clone https://your-git-server.com/server-side.git local-http-server-repo
----

*define the contract locally in the repo of Fraud Detection service*

As consumers we need to define what exactly we want to achieve. We need to formulate our expectations. That's why we write the following contract.

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
package contracts

org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
			request { // (1)
				method 'PUT' // (2)
				url '/fraudcheck' // (3)
				body([ // (4)
					clientId: value(consumer(regex('[0-9]{10}'))),
					loanAmount: 99999
					])
				headers { // (5)
					header('Content-Type', 'application/vnd.fraud.v1+json')
				}
			}
			response { // (6)
				status 200 // (7)
				body([ // (8)
					fraudCheckStatus: "FRAUD",
					rejectionReason: "Amount too high"
				])
				headers { // (9)
					 header('Content-Type': value(
							 producer(regex('application/vnd.fraud.v1.json.*')),
							 consumer('application/vnd.fraud.v1+json'))
					 )
				}
			}
}

/*
Since we don't want to force on the user to hardcode values of fields that are dynamic
(timestamps, database ids etc.), one can provide parametrize those entries by using the
`value(consumer(...), producer(...))` method. That way what's present in the `consumer`
section will end up in the produced stub. What's there in the `producer` will end up in the
autogenerated test. If you provide only the regular expression side without the concrete
value then Spring Cloud Contract will generate one for you.

From the Consumer perspective, when shooting a request in the integration test:

(1) - If the consumer sends a request
(2) - With the "PUT" method
(3) - to the URL "/fraudcheck"
(4) - with the JSON body that
 * has a field `clientId` that matches a regular expression `[0-9]{10}`
 * has a field `loanAmount` that is equal to `99999`
(5) - with header `Content-Type` equal to `application/vnd.fraud.v1+json`
(6) - then the response will be sent with
(7) - status equal `200`
(8) - and JSON body equal to
 { "fraudCheckStatus": "FRAUD", "rejectionReason": "Amount too high" }
(9) - with header `Content-Type` equal to `application/vnd.fraud.v1+json`

From the Producer perspective, in the autogenerated producer-side test:

(1) - A request will be sent to the producer
(2) - With the "PUT" method
(3) - to the URL "/fraudcheck"
(4) - with the JSON body that
 * has a field `clientId` that will have a generated value that matches a regular expression `[0-9]{10}`
 * has a field `loanAmount` that is equal to `99999`
(5) - with header `Content-Type` equal to `application/vnd.fraud.v1+json`
(6) - then the test will assert if the response has been sent with
(7) - status equal `200`
(8) - and JSON body equal to
 { "fraudCheckStatus": "FRAUD", "rejectionReason": "Amount too high" }
(9) - with header `Content-Type` matching `application/vnd.fraud.v1+json.*`
 */
----

The Contract is written using a statically typed Groovy DSL. You might be wondering what are those
`value(client(...), server(...))` parts. By using this notation Spring Cloud Contract allows you to
define parts of a JSON / URL / etc. which are dynamic. In case of an identifier or a timestamp you
don't want to hardcode a value. You want to allow some different ranges of values. That's why for
the consumer side you can set regular expressions matching those values. You can provide the body
either by means of a map notation or String with interpolations.
https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_contract_dsl[Consult the docs
for more information.] We highly recommend using the map notation!

TIP: It's really important that you understand the map notation to set up contracts. Please read the
http://groovy-lang.org/json.html[Groovy docs regarding JSON]

The aforementioned contract is an agreement between two sides that:

- if an HTTP request is sent with
** a method `PUT` on an endpoint `/fraudcheck`
** JSON body with `clientId` matching the regular expression `[0-9]{10}` and `loanAmount` equal to `99999`
** and with a header `Content-Type` equal to `application/vnd.fraud.v1+json`
- then an HTTP response would be sent to the consumer that
** has status `200`
** contains JSON body with the `fraudCheckStatus` field containing a value `FRAUD` and the `rejectionReason` field having value `Amount too high`
** and a `Content-Type` header with a value of `application/vnd.fraud.v1+json`

Once we're ready to check the API in practice in the integration tests we need to just install the stubs locally

*add the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier plugin*

We can add either Maven or Gradle plugin - in this example we'll show how to add Maven. First we need to add the `Spring Cloud Contract` BOM.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<dependencyManagement>

        <dependency>

            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

Next, the `Spring Cloud Contract Verifier` Maven plugin

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>

    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <baseClassForTests>com.example.fraud.MvcTest</baseClassForTests>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

Since the plugin was added we get the `Spring Cloud Contract Verifier` features which from the provided contracts:

- generate and run tests
- produce and install stubs

We don't want to generate tests since we, as consumers, want only to play with the stubs. That's why we need to skip the tests generation and execution. When we execute:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
cd local-http-server-repo
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests

In the logs we'll see something like this:

It's confirming that the stubs of the `http-server` have been installed in the local repository.

*run the integration tests*

In order to profit from the Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner functionality of automatic stub downloading you have to do the following in our consumer side project (`Loan Application service`).

Add the `Spring Cloud Contract` BOM

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<dependencyManagement>

            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

Add the dependency to `Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner`

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-stub-runner</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

Annotate your test class with `@AutoConfigureStubRunner`. In the annotation provide the group id and artifact id for the Stub Runner to download stubs of your collaborators. Also provide the offline work switch since you're playing with the collaborators offline (optional step).

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:+:stubs:8080"}, workOffline = true)
public class LoanApplicationServiceTests {
----

Now if you run your tests you'll see sth like this:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----

Which means that Stub Runner has found your stubs and started a server for app with group id `com.example`, artifact id `http-server` with version `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` of the stubs and with `stubs` classifier on port `8080`.

*file a PR*

What we did until now is an iterative process. We can play around with the contract, install it locally and work on the consumer side until we're happy with the contract.

Once we're satisfied with the results and the test passes publish a PR to the server side. Currently the consumer side work is done.

===== Producer side (Fraud Detection server)

As a developer of the Fraud Detection server (a server to the Loan Issuance service):

*initial implementation*

As a reminder here you can see the initial implementation

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@RequestMapping(
        value = "/fraudcheck",
        method = PUT,
        consumes = FRAUD_SERVICE_JSON_VERSION_1,
        produces = FRAUD_SERVICE_JSON_VERSION_1)
public FraudCheckResult fraudCheck(@RequestBody FraudCheck fraudCheck) {
return new FraudCheckResult(FraudCheckStatus.OK, NO_REASON);
}
----

*take over the PR*

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
git checkout -b contract-change-pr master
git pull https://your-git-server.com/server-side-fork.git contract-change-pr
----

You have to add the dependencies needed by the autogenerated tests

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
    <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-verifier</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

In the configuration of the Maven plugin we passed the `baseClassForTests` property

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${spring-cloud-contract.version}</version>
    <extensions>true</extensions>
    <configuration>
        <baseClassForTests>com.example.fraud.MvcTest</baseClassForTests>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

That's because all the generated tests will extend that class. Over there you can set up your Spring Context or whatever is necessary. In our case we're using http://rest-assured.io/[Rest Assured MVC] to start the server side `FraudDetectionController`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
package com.example.fraud;

import com.example.fraud.FraudDetectionController;
import com.jayway.restassured.module.mockmvc.RestAssuredMockMvc;

import org.junit.Before;

public class MvcTest {

	@Before
	public void setup() {
		RestAssuredMockMvc.standaloneSetup(new FraudDetectionController());
	}

	public void assertThatRejectionReasonIsNull(Object rejectionReason) {
		assert rejectionReason == null;
	}
}
----

Now, if you run the `./mvnw clean install` you would get sth like this:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
Results :

Tests in error:
  ContractVerifierTest.validate_shouldMarkClientAsFraud:32 » IllegalState Parsed...
----

That's because you have a new contract from which a test was generated and it failed since you haven't implemented the feature. The autogenerated test would look like this:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Test
public void validate_shouldMarkClientAsFraud() throws Exception {
    // given:
        MockMvcRequestSpecification request = given()
                .header("Content-Type", "application/vnd.fraud.v1+json")
                .body("{\"clientId\":\"1234567890\",\"loanAmount\":99999}");

    // when:
        ResponseOptions response = given().spec(request)
                .put("/fraudcheck");

    // then:
        assertThat(response.statusCode()).isEqualTo(200);
        assertThat(response.header("Content-Type")).matches("application/vnd.fraud.v1.json.*");
    // and:
        DocumentContext parsedJson = JsonPath.parse(response.getBody().asString());
        assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("fraudCheckStatus").matches("[A-Z]{5}");
        assertThatJson(parsedJson).field("rejectionReason").isEqualTo("Amount too high");
}
----

As you can see all the `producer()` parts of the Contract that were present in the `value(consumer(...), producer(...))` blocks got injected into the test.

What's important here to note is that on the producer side we also are doing TDD. We have expectations in form of a test. This test is shooting a request to our own application to an URL, headers and body defined in the contract. It also is expecting very precisely defined values in the response. In other words you have is your `red` part of `red`, `green` and `refactor`. Time to convert the `red` into the `green`.

*write the missing implementation*

Now since we now what is the expected input and expected output let's write the missing implementation.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@RequestMapping(
        value = "/fraudcheck",
        method = PUT,
        consumes = FRAUD_SERVICE_JSON_VERSION_1,
        produces = FRAUD_SERVICE_JSON_VERSION_1)
public FraudCheckResult fraudCheck(@RequestBody FraudCheck fraudCheck) {
if (amountGreaterThanThreshold(fraudCheck)) {
    return new FraudCheckResult(FraudCheckStatus.FRAUD, AMOUNT_TOO_HIGH);
}
return new FraudCheckResult(FraudCheckStatus.OK, NO_REASON);
}
----

If we execute `./mvnw clean install` again the tests will pass. Since the `Spring Cloud Contract Verifier` plugin adds the tests to the `generated-test-sources` you can actually run those tests from your IDE.

*deploy your app*

Once you've finished your work it's time to deploy your change. First merge the branch

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff contract-change-pr
git push origin master
----

Then we assume that your CI would run sth like `./mvnw clean deploy` which would publish both the application and the stub artifcats.

===== Consumer side (Loan Issuance) final step

As a developer of the Loan Issuance service (a consumer of the Fraud Detection server):

*merge branch to master*

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff contract-change-pr
----

*work online*

Now you can disable the offline work for Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner ad provide where the repository with your stubs is placed. At this moment the stubs of the server side will be automatically downloaded from Nexus / Artifactory.
You can switch off the value of the `workOffline` parameter in your annotation. Below you can see an
example of achieving the same by changing the properties.

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
stubrunner:
  ids: 'com.example:http-server-dsl:+:stubs:8080'
  repositoryRoot: http://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot
----

And that's it!

=== FAQ

==== Why use Spring Cloud Contract Verifier and not X ?

For the time being Spring Cloud Contract Verifier is a JVM based tool. So it could be your first pick when you're already creating
software for the JVM. This project has a lot of really interesting features but especially quite a few of them definitely make
Spring Cloud Contract Verifier stand out on the "market" of Consumer Driven Contract (CDC) tooling. Out of many the most interesting are:

- Possibility to do CDC with messaging
- Clear and easy to use, statically typed DSL
- Possibility to copy paste your current JSON file to the contract and only edit its elements
- Automatic generation of tests from the defined Contract
- Stub Runner functionality - the stubs are automatically downloaded at runtime from Nexus / Artifactory
- Spring Cloud integration - no discovery service is needed for integration tests

==== What is this value(consumer(), producer()) ?

One of the biggest challenges related to stubs is their reusability. Only if they can be vastly used, will they serve their purpose.
What typically makes that difficult are the hard-coded values of request / response elements. For example dates or ids.
Imagine the following JSON request

[source,json,indent=0]
----
{
    "time" : "2016-10-10 20:10:15",
    "id" : "9febab1c-6f36-4a0b-88d6-3b6a6d81cd4a",
    "body" : "foo"
}
----

and JSON response

[source,json,indent=0]
----
{
    "time" : "2016-10-10 21:10:15",
    "id" : "c4231e1f-3ca9-48d3-b7e7-567d55f0d051",
    "body" : "bar"
}
----

Imagine the pain required to set proper value of the `time` field (let's assume that this content is generated by the
database) by changing the clock in the system or providing stub implementations of data providers. The same is related
to the field called `id`. Will you create a stubbed implementation of UUID generator? Makes little sense...

So as a consumer you would like to send a request that matches any form of a time or any UUID. That way your system
will work as usual - will generate data and you won't have to stub anything out. Let's assume that in case of the aforementioned
JSON the most important part is the `body` field. You can focus on that and provide matching for other fields. In other words
you would like the stub to work like this:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
{
    "time" : "SOMETHING THAT MATCHES TIME",
    "id" : "SOMETHING THAT MATCHES UUID",
    "body" : "foo"
}
----

As far as the response goes as a consumer you need a concrete value that you can operate on. So such a JSON is valid

[source,json,indent=0]
----
{
    "time" : "2016-10-10 21:10:15",
    "id" : "c4231e1f-3ca9-48d3-b7e7-567d55f0d051",
    "body" : "bar"
}
----

As you could see in the previous sections we generate tests from contracts. So from the producer's side the situation looks
much different. We're parsing the provided contract and in the test we want to send a real request to your endpoints.
So for the case of a producer for the request we can't have any sort of matching. We need concrete values that the
producer's backend can work on. Such a JSON would be a valid one:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
{
    "time" : "2016-10-10 20:10:15",
    "id" : "9febab1c-6f36-4a0b-88d6-3b6a6d81cd4a",
    "body" : "foo"
}
----

On the other hand from the point of view of the validity of the contract the response doesn't necessarily have to
contain concrete values of `time` or `id`. Let's say that you generate those on the producer side - again, you'd
have to do a lot of stubbing to ensure that you always return the same values. That's why from the producer's side
what you might want is the following response:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
{
    "time" : "SOMETHING THAT MATCHES TIME",
    "id" : "SOMETHING THAT MATCHES UUID",
    "body" : "bar"
}
----

How can you then provide one time a matcher for the consumer and a concrete value for the producer and vice versa?
In Spring Cloud Contract we're allowing you to provide a *dynamic value*. That means that it can differ for both
sides of the communication. You can pass the values:

Either via the `value` method

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
value(consumer(...), producer(...))
value(stub(...), test(...))
value(client(...), server(...))
----

or using the `$()` method

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
$(consumer(...), producer(...))
$(stub(...), test(...))
$(client(...), server(...))
----

You can read more about this in the https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract.html#_contract_dsl[Contract DSL section].

Calling `value()` or `$()` tells Spring Cloud Contract that you will be passing a dynamic value.
Inside the `consumer()` method you pass the value that should be used on the consumer side (in the generated stub).
Inside the `producer()` method you pass the value that should be used on the producer side (in the generated test).

TIP: If on one side you have passed the regular expression and you haven't passed the other, then the
other side will get auto-generated.

Most often you will use that method together with the `regex` helper method. E.g. `consumer(regex('[0-9]{10}'))`.

To sum it up the contract for the aforementioned scenario would look more or less like this (the regular expression
for time and UUID are simplified and most likely invalid but we want to keep things very simple in this example):

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
				request {
					method 'GET'
					url '/someUrl'
					body([
					    time : value(consumer(regex('[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2} [0-2][0-9]-[0-5][0-9]-[0-5][0-9]')),
					    id: value(consumer(regex('[0-9a-zA-z]{8}-[0-9a-zA-z]{4}-[0-9a-zA-z]{4}-[0-9a-zA-z]{12}'))
					    body: "foo"
					])
				}
			response {
				status 200
				body([
					    time : value(producer(regex('[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2} [0-2][0-9]-[0-5][0-9]-[0-5][0-9]')),
					    id: value([producer(regex('[0-9a-zA-z]{8}-[0-9a-zA-z]{4}-[0-9a-zA-z]{4}-[0-9a-zA-z]{12}'))
					    body: "bar"
					])
			}
}
----

IMPORTANT: Please read the http://groovy-lang.org/json.html[Groovy docs related to JSON] to understand how to
properly structure the request / response bodies.

==== How to do Stubs versioning?

===== API Versioning

Let's try to answer a question what versioning really means. If you're referring to the API version then there are
different approaches.

- use Hypermedia, links and do not version your API by any means
- pass versions through headers / urls

I will not try to answer a question which approach is better. Whatever suit your needs and allows you to generate
business value should be picked.

Let's assume that you do version your API. In that case you should provide as many contracts as many versions you support.
You can create a subfolder for every version or append it to th contract name - whatever suits you more.

===== JAR versioning

If by versioning you mean the version of the JAR that contains the stubs then there are essentially two main approaches.

Let's assume that you're doing Continuous Delivery / Deployment which means that you're generating a new version of
the jar each time you go through the pipeline and that jar can go to production at any time. For example your jar version
looks like this (it got built on the 20.10.2016 at 20:15:21) :

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
1.0.0.20161020-201521-RELEASE
----

In that case your generated stub jar will look like this.

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
1.0.0.20161020-201521-RELEASE-stubs.jar
----

In this case you should inside your `application.yml` or `@AutoConfigureStubRunner` when referencing stubs provide the
 latest version of the stubs. You can do that by passing the `+` sign. Example

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:+:stubs:8080"})
----

If the versioning however is fixed (e.g. `1.0.4.RELEASE` or `2.1.1`) then you have to set the concrete value of the jar
version. Example for 2.1.1.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:2.1.1:stubs:8080"})
----

===== Dev or prod stubs

You can manipulate the classifier to run the tests against current development version of the stubs of other services
 or the ones that were deployed to production. If you alter your build to deploy the stubs with the `prod-stubs` classifier
 once you reach production deployment then you can run tests in one case with dev stubs and one with prod stubs.

Example of tests using development version of stubs

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:+:stubs:8080"})
----

Example of tests using production version of stubs

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = {"com.example:http-server-dsl:+:prod-stubs:8080"})
----

You can pass those values also via properties from your deployment pipeline.

===== Common repo with contracts

Another way of storing contracts other than having them with the producer is keeping them in a common place.
It can be related to security issues where the consumers can't clone the producer's code. Also if you keep
contracts in a single place then you, as a producer, will know how many consumers you have and which
consumer will you break with your local changes.

* Repo structure *

Let's assume that we have a producer with coordinates `com.example:server` and 3 consumers: `client1`,
`client2`, `client3`. Then in the repository with common contracts you would have the following setup
(which you can checkout https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/master/samples/standalone/contracts[here]:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
├── com
│   └── example
│       └── server
│           ├── client1
│           │   └── expectation.groovy
│           ├── client2
│           │   └── expectation.groovy
│           ├── client3
│           │   └── expectation.groovy
│           └── pom.xml
├── mvnw
├── mvnw.cmd
├── pom.xml
└── src
    └── assembly
        └── contracts.xml
----

As you can see the under the slash-delimited groupid `/` artifact id folder (`com/example/server`) you have
expectations of the 3 consumers (`client1`, `client2` and `client3`). Expectations are the standard Groovy DSL
contract files as described throughout this documentation. This repository has to produce a JAR file that maps
one to one to the contents of the repo.

Example of a `pom.xml` inside the `server` folder.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
Unresolved directive in verifier/introduction.adoc - include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/master/samples/standalone/contracts/com/example/server/pom.xml[indent=0]

As you can see there are no dependencies other than the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier Maven plugin.
Those poms are necessary for the consumer side to run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` to locally install
 stubs of the producer project.

The `pom.xml` in the root folder can look like this:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
Unresolved directive in verifier/introduction.adoc - include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/master/samples/standalone/contracts/pom.xml[indent=0]

It's using the assembly plugin in order to build the JAR with all the contracts. Example of such setup is here:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
Unresolved directive in verifier/introduction.adoc - include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/master/samples/standalone/contracts/src/assembly/contracts.xml[indent=0]

*Workflow*

The workflow would look similar to the one presented in the `Step by step guide to CDC`. The only difference
 is that the producer doesn't own the contracts anymore. So the consumer and the producer have to work on
 common contracts in a common repository.

_Consumer_

When the *consumer* wants to work on the contracts offline, instead of cloning the producer code, the
consumer team clones the common repository, goes to the required producer's folder (e.g. `com/example/server`)
and runs `mvn clean install -DskipTests` to install locally the stubs converted from the contracts.

TIP: You need to have http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven installed locally]

_Producer_

As a *producer* it's enough to alter the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier to provide the URL and the dependency
of the JAR containing the contracts:

With this setup the JAR with groupid `com.example.standalone` and artifactid `contracts` will be downloaded
from `http://link/to/your/nexus/or/artifactory/or/sth`. It will be then unpacked in a local temporary folder
and contracts present under the `com/example/server` will be picked as the ones used to generate the
tests and the stubs. Due to this convention the producer team will know which consumer teams will be broken
when some incompatible changes are done.

The rest of the flow looks the same.

== Documentation

You can read more about Spring Cloud Contract Verifier by reading the {documentation_url}[docs]

== Contributing

Spring Cloud is released under the non-restrictive Apache 2.0 license,
and follows a very standard Github development process, using Github
tracker for issues and merging pull requests into master. If you want
to contribute even something trivial please do not hesitate, but
follow the guidelines below.

=== Sign the Contributor License Agreement
Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the
https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[Contributor License Agreement].
Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main
repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an
author credit if we do.  Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and
given the ability to merge pull requests.

=== Code of Conduct
This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/code-of-conduct.adoc[code of
conduct]. By participating, you  are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

=== Code Conventions and Housekeeping
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* Use the Spring Framework code format conventions. If you use Eclipse
  you can import formatter settings using the
  `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` file from the
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-build/master/spring-cloud-dependencies-parent/eclipse-code-formatter.xml[Spring
  Cloud Build] project. If using IntelliJ, you can use the
  http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546[Eclipse Code Formatter
  Plugin] to import the same file.
* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an
  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is
  for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files
  in the project)
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more
  than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or
  other target branch in the main project).
* When writing a commit message please follow http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions],
  if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit
  message (where XXXX is the issue number).

== How to build it

=== Project structure

Here you can find the Spring Cloud Contract folder structure

```
├── samples
├── scripts
├── spring-cloud-contract-dependencies
├── spring-cloud-contract-spec
├── spring-cloud-contract-starters
├── spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner
├── spring-cloud-contract-tools
├── spring-cloud-contract-verifier
├── spring-cloud-contract-wiremock
└── tests
```

 - `samples` - folder contains test samples together with standalone ones used also to build documentation
 - `scripts` - contains scripts to build and test `Spring Cloud Contract` with Maven, Gradle and standalone projects
 - `spring-cloud-contract-dependencies` - contains Spring Cloud Contract BOM
 - `spring-cloud-contract-starters` - contains Spring Cloud Contract Starters
 - `spring-cloud-contract-spec` - contains specification modules (contains concept of a Contract)
 - `spring-cloud-contract-stub-runner` - contains Stub Runner related modules
 - `spring-cloud-contract-tools` - Gradle and Maven plugin for `Spring Cloud Contract Verifier`
 - `spring-cloud-contract-verifier` - core of the `Spring Cloud Contract Verifier` functionality
 - `spring-cloud-contract-wiremock` - all WireMock related functionality
 - `tests` - integration tests for different messaging technologies

=== Commands

To build the core functionality together with Maven Plugin you can run

```
./mvnw clean install -P integration
```

Calling that function will build core, Maven plugin, Gradle plugin and run end to end tests on the
standalone samples in proper order (both for Maven and Gradle).

To build the Gradle Plugin only

```
cd spring-cloud-contract-tools/spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin
./gradlew clean build
```
